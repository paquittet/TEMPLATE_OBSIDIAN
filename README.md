# Description of the repository
This is the core of my Obsidian template that allows me to significantly improve the way I personally approach note-taking, especially when taking notes on scientific articles. 

# How to use this Obsidian template
A quick non-professionnal video of me presenting you what you can do with this templayte is available in the repository. I would advise to watch it first (it lasts $\approx$ 10m) to directly know if you could benefit from this software.

Some steps are needed in order to use this template. Nothing to complicated. If you encounter any problems, feel free to contact me at pierre-alexandre.quittet@cefe.cnrs.fr or directly come by my office at the CEFE (office 2bis, groundfloor), I'll be more than happy to help you.
