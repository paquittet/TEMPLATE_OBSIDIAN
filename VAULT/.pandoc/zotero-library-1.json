The present study describes the structure and the organization of warbling song in individuals from varied geographical origins. In all cases, warbling is shown to be an extremely complex song in which there is much contrast: very different notes follow each other and are even superimposed. Higher levels of organizations are present: notes are grouped in repeating units, the motifs, each of which is sung in bouts of 1 to 12 repetitions, and finally these bouts show a clear sequential organization. A certain amount of variability occurs at each of these levels: slight variations are seen from one rendition of a given motif to the next; the number of repetitions of each motif varies from one song sequence to another and the sequential organization of bouts seems to be able to vary seasonally. All these characteristics were found in all individuals. Nevertheless, warbling appears to be an essentially individual song. Beyond two or three species-specific motifs, the others in the repertoire are individually characteristic. The beginnings and endings of the songs are clearly defined commencing usually with an individual motif whilst ending with a species-specific motif. We observed marked differences between individuals in repertoire size, extending from about 20 to more than 35 different motifs. This is the only measure of the repertoire that we have been able to define for this continuous song. /// Les étourneaux mâles ont deux catégories très différentes de chant: les sifflements et les gazouillis. La présente étude décrit la structure et l'organisation du chant gazouillé chez des individus de diverses origines geographiques. Dans tous les cas, le gazouillis apparaît comme un chant extrêmement complexe présentant beaucoup de contraste: succession et même superposition de notes très différentes. Des niveaux supérieurs d'organisation existent: les notes sont groupées en unités répétées, les motifs, chacun chanté en bouts de 1 à 12 répétitions et, finalement, ces bouts présentent une nette organisation séquentielle. Une certaine variabilité apparaît à chacun de ces niveaux: de légères variations existent d'une émission à l'autre d'un motif donné; le nombre des répétitions de chaque motif varie d'une séquence de chant à l'autre et l'organisation séquentielle des bouts semble pouvoir varier selon les saisons. Toutes ces caractéristiques sont présentes chez tous les individus. Néanmoins, le gazouillis apparaît essentiellement comme un chant individuel. A part deux ou trois motifs spécifiques, les autres motifs du répertoire sont des caractéristiques individuelles. Les débuts et les fins des chants sont nettement définis, commençant généralement par un motif individuel tandis qu'ils finissent par un motif spécifique. Nous avons observé des différences individuelles marquées dans la taille du répertoire, allant d'une vingtaine de motifs différents à plus de 35. C'est la seule mesure du répertoire que nous ayions pu établir pour ce chant continu.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Adret-Hausberger","given":"M."},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"P.

The type of response and its temporal characteristics could be related to internal sequential organizational rules. Moreover, starlings discriminate between two dialectal variants of a given theme and respond more often and more quickly to the familiar dialect. A social influence on the choice of theme by the individual can also be observed in foraging flocks and roosts where song is frequently given. Observations of such groups reveal that one theme predominates on each given occasion and that it depends on the number of individuals present and on the type of group (flock or roost). This is probably a function of the tendency to match. Previous observations of flights toward the roost showed that birds originating from different dialectal areas congregate in such groups.

In particular, among the social species (i.e. all except Marmota monax), the yellow-bellied marmot appears quite different from the others. The yellow-bellied marmot is primarily polygynous with an intermediate level of sociality and low reproductive skew among females. In contrast, all other social marmot species are mainly monogamous, highly social and with marked reproductive skew among females. To understand the evolution of this difference in reproductive skew, I examined four possible explanations identiﬁed from reproductive skew theory. From the literature, I then reviewed evidence to investigate if marmot species differ in: (1) the ability of dominants to control the reproduction of subordinates; (2) the degree of relatedness between group members; (3) the beneﬁt for subordinates of remaining in the social group; and (4) the beneﬁt for dominants of retaining subordinates. I found that the optimal skew hypothesis may apply for both sets of species. I suggest that yellow-bellied marmot females may beneﬁt from retaining subordinate females and in return have to concede them reproduction. On the contrary, monogamous marmot species may gain by suppressing the reproduction of subordinate females to maximise the efﬁciency of social thermoregulation, even at the risk of departure of subordinate females from the family group. Finally, I discuss scenarios for the simultaneous evolution of sociality, monogamy and reproductive skew in marmots. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

These methods differ considerably in their suitability for providing unbiased data of various kinds. Below is a summary of the major recommended uses of each technique: State or Event Sampling Method Sampling Recommended Uses 1. Ad Libitum (p. 235) either Primarily of heuristic value; suggestive; records of rare but significant events. 2. Sociometric Matrix Completion (p. 240) event Asymmetry within dyads. 3. Focal-Animal (p. 242) either Sequential constraints; percent of time; rates; durations; nearest neighbor relationships. 4.

Instantaneous and Scan (p. 258) state Percent of time; synchrony; subgroups. In this paper, I have tried to point out the major strengths and weaknesses of each sampling method. Some methods are intrinsically biased with respect to many variables, others to fewer. In choosing a sampling method the main question is whether the procedure results in a biased sample of the variables under study. A method can produce a biased sample directly, as a result of intrinsic bias with respect to a study variable, or secondarily due to some degree of dependence (correlation) between the study variable and a directly-biased variable. In order to choose a sampling technique, the observer needs to consider carefully the characteristics of behavior and social interactions that are relevant to the study population and the research questions at hand. In most studies one will not have adequate empirical knowledge of the dependencies between relevant variables. Under the circumstances, the observer should avoid intrinsic biases to whatever extent possible, in particular those that direcly affect the variables under study. Finally, it will often be possible to use more than one sampling method in a study. Such samples can be taken successively or, under favorable conditions, even concurrently. For example, we have found it possible to take Instantaneous Samples of the identities and distances of nearest neighbors of a focal individual at five or ten minute intervals during Focal-Animal (behavior) Samples on that individual. Often during Focal-Animal Sampling one can also record All Occurrences of Some Behaviors, for the whole social group, for categories of conspicuous behavior, such as predation, intergroup contact, drinking, and so on. The extent to which concurrent multiple sampling is feasible will depend very much on the behavior categories and rate of occurrence, the observational conditions, etc. Where feasible, such multiple sampling can greatly aid in the efficient use of research time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Altmann","given":"Jeanne"}],"citation-key":"altmannObservationalStudyBehavior1974","container-title":"Behaviour","ISSN":"0005-7959","issue":"3/4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1974"]]},"page":"227-267","publisher":"Brill","source":"JSTOR","title":"Observational Study of Behavior: Sampling Methods","title-short":"Observational Study of Behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4533591","volume":"49"},{"id":"amaralDurationEnvironmentalEnrichment2008","abstract":"A wide range of data in the literature suggests that environmental enrichment has beneficial effects on various cognitive parameters in rodents.

We recorded from three pallial brain areas: the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), an analogue of mammalian prefrontal cortex; the entopallium (ENTO), an intermediary visual area similar to primate extrastriate cortex; and the mesopallium ventrolaterale (MVL), a higher-order visual area similar to primate higher-order extrastriate cortex, while pigeons performed an S+/S− Picasso versus Monet discrimination task. In NCL, we found that activity reflected reward-driven categorisation, with a strong left-hemisphere dominance. In ENTO, we found that activity reflected stimulus-driven categorisation, also with a strong left-hemisphere dominance. Finally, in MVL, we found that activity reflected stimulus-driven categorisation, but no hemispheric differences were apparent.

Why have males in many animals evolved more conspicuous ornaments, signals, and weapons than females? How can such traits evolve although they may reduce male survival? Such questions prompted Darwin's perhaps most scientifically controversial idea--the theory of sexual selection. It still challenges researchers today as they try to understand how competition for mates can favor the variety of sex-dimorphic traits. Reviewing theoretical and empirical work in this very active field, Malte Andersson, a leading contributor himself, provides a major up-to-date synthesis of sexual selection. The author describes the theory and its recent development; examines models, methods, and empirical tests; and identifies many unsolved problems. Among the topics discussed are the selection and evolution of mating preferences; relations between sexual selection and speciation; constraints on sexual selection; and sex differences in signals, body size, and weapons.

If two mates share a preference to adopt the same sexual role, mating interests are inherently incompatible. We review previous models that have explored the origin of, and resolutions to, such gender conflicts: (1) sex allocation models; (2) risk-averse models; (3) costly male function models; and (4) game-theoretical models. None of these satisfactorily accounts for the diversity found in hermaphrodite mating systems, either because the assumptions of the model reflect lifetime decisions rather than single mating decisions, or because only a narrow set of environmental conditions is considered. Furthermore, some often cited predictions such as a preference for copulating in the female role or a prevalence of conditional sperm exchange (‘sperm trading’) face limited empirical support. To reconcile and extend these previous ideas, we propose the gender ratio hypothesis as a more general model framework. Here, sex role preferences derive from the potential fitness gain per mating event. Preferences can thus vary considerably within and between individuals, but are predicted to be usually male biased. By combining sex role preference with mating rate, our hypothesis can explain the existence of a wide range of hermaphrodite mating systems, including unconditional reciprocity in systems where sperm trading has been predicted but not found.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Anthes","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Putz","given":"Annika"},{"family":"Michiels","given":"Nico K."}],"citation-key":"anthesSexRolePreferences2006","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.09.017","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-12","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Sex role preferences, gender conflict and sperm trading in simultaneous hermaphrodites: a new framework","title-short":"Sex role preferences, gender conflict and sperm trading in simultaneous hermaphrodites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347206001345","volume":"72"},{"id":"antonovaUntrainedBirdsAbility2021","abstract":"During recognition process, multiple parameters of the encountered stimulus may play a role.

Body size and hibernation are two critical features of marmot biology from which sociality evolves. The high correlation (r = 0.91) between immergence mass and mass loss suggests that species are heavier because they require more mass to survive the hibernation period. Marmots increase mass either by having a larger frame or by increasing the amount of mass per frame. Emergence and immergence mass are linearly related to body length; but change in mass is curvilinearly related to body length: large species use relatively more mass. An analysis of mass:length ratios reveals that species with a relatively high immergence mass use considerable mass during the hibernation period whereas species with a relatively high emergence mass use considerable mass after emergence. The consequence of large body size and a short growing season is that young in all but one species require two or more growing seasons to reach reproductive maturity. All species reach a maturity index for dispersal by age one; however, only two species disperse by that age and several species delay dispersal beyond the age of first reproduction. All species are reproductively mature by age two, but many species delay reproduction for one or more years. Delayed dispersal produces social groups of high relatedness. A cost of sociality is reproductive suppression; reproductive loss is partially compensated by increased survivorship and alloparental care. Subordinate adults also may reproduce or succeed to territorial status. Alloparental care occurs during hibernation when subordinate adults assist in social thermoregulation of closely related young. Thus, marmots have the characteristics of cooperative breeding. The following sequence of events is hypothesized to have occurred in the evolution of marmot sociality. Large size and a short growing season required the retention of offspring in their natal group for one or more additional years to reach maturity. Habitat saturation led to delayed dispersal, which in tum, increased survivorship. When subordinate adults remained in the social unit, they could participate in social thermoregulation and alloparental care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Armitage","given":"K.

These hypotheses are tested in this paper for one of the most social of marmot species, the alpine marmot. The animals studied lived in groups within territories defended by a dominant male and female, or as floaters lacking a well-defined home range. Offspring did not disperse before sexual maturity at age 2 (Fig. 1). Only territorial females bred, whereas territorial males were not able to monopolize reproduction likewise (Table 2). Dispersers had similar spring mass to nondispersers (Table 4). Hence, hypothesis 1 is not supported, at least not for adult-sized, > 2 years old animals. During their residency, 19% of subordinates obtained their natal territory or a neighboring one (Fig. 2). Long distance dispersal bore a high mortality risk. Thus, toleration of mature offspring could well represent parental investment. Other results, however, suggest additional influences on the timing of dispersal. (i) Males dispersed later than females (Fig. 3), possibly because of mate sharing by territorial males (see Emlen 1982). (ii) The higher mass loss of dispersers during the previous winter indicates that weak animals were forced to leave (Table 5) despite presumably lower chances of becoming territorial (Table 3).

How reproductive competition may be expressed among adult group males during mating was investigated, in particular whether reproduction is suppressed in subordinate males. Among adult subordinate males at least 3 years old, potential oﬀspring of the territorial male (‘sons’) had androgen levels as high as those of territorial males whereas non-related group males (‘non-sons’) had signiﬁcantly lower vernal levels, similar to those of 2-year-old individuals. Plasma androgen and corticosteroid titres were negatively correlated in subordinates at least 2 years old but were positively correlated in territorial males. Corticosteroids correlated negatively with body mass in sons and were high regardless of body mass in non-sons. Androgens mirrored these relations. Injuries from intraspeciﬁc ﬁghting were more frequent among non-sons than among sons. Androgens and corticosteroids of territorial males correlated positively with the number of non-sons in the group, whereas the number of sons in a group had no comparable or at best the opposite eﬀect. These results indicate that territorial males attempt to inhibit reproduction in other group males but adjust their eﬀort according to inhibition costs (presumably increasing with a subordinate male’s body size) and beneﬁts (which are lower in sons). Marmots with high corticosteroid levels in spring gained less mass during the following summer. This could impair winter survival or reproductive success in the next year. Body-mass loss during hibernation correlated positively with vernal androgen levels in adult males. Only males with suﬃcient summer mass gain may be capable of sustaining energetically costly interruptions of torpor at the end of winter, necessary for gonadal development. The interactions between group members around mating time may reﬂect general patterns throughout the year that lead to selective reproductive inhibition in the group via eﬀects on mass gain, hibernation mass loss and gonadal development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Arnold","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Dittami","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"arnoldReproductiveSuppressionMale1997","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1006/anbe.1996.0277","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",1]]},"language":"en","page":"53-66","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reproductive suppression in male alpine marmots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347296902778","volume":"53"},{"id":"arnoldSocialThermoregulationHibernation1988","abstract":"Body temperature (Tb) of socially hibernating alpine marmots, a pair and two family groups, was monitored continuously from October to March with implanted temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters.

The traditional view of reproduction as a joint venture undertaken by two individuals, aimed at replicating their common genome, is being challenged by a growing body of evidence showing that the evolutionary interests of interacting males and females diverge. This book demonstrates that, despite a shared genome, conflicts between interacting males and females are ubiquitous, and that selection in the two sexes is continuously pulling this genome in opposite directions. These conflicts drive the evolution of a great variety of those traits that distinguish the sexes and also contribute to the diversification of lineages. Göran Arnqvist and Locke Rowe present an array of evidence for sexual conflict throughout nature, and they set these conflicts into the well-established theoretical framework of sexual selection. The recognition of conflict between the sexes is transforming our theories for the evolution of mating systems and the sexes themselves.

To address this gap, we documented the spatiotemporal prevalence of sex‐biased weevil damage in a gynodioecious strawberry. We then conducted path analysis to evaluate the direct and indirect pathways for weevils to affect female and male fertility and to mediate selection in two experimental gardens. Direct effects of weevils significantly reduced fertility and mediated selection on reproductive traits, even in the nonpreferred sex (females). Weevils significantly reduced floral display size in hermaphrodites in both gardens, and this translated into a substantial negative indirect effect on male fertility in the garden where the pathway to fertility via display was stronger. Thus, indirect effects of weevils can contribute to selection in hermaphrodites, which gain the majority of their fitness via male function. Our results also indicate that weevils often play a larger role than pollinators in shaping reproductive phenotype and thus raise the intriguing possibility that antagonists may be drivers of sexual dimorphism. Finally, our results support the view that mutualists, antagonists, and the abiotic environment should be considered when attempting to understand reproductive trait evolution in gender‐dimorphic species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ashman","given":"Tia‐Lynn"},{"family":"Penet","given":"Laurent"}],"citation-key":"ashmanDirectIndirectEffects2007","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/513150","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"page":"595-608","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Direct and Indirect Effects of a Sex‐Biased Antagonist on Male and Female Fertility: Consequences for Reproductive Trait Evolution in a Gender‐Dimorphic Plant.","title-short":"Direct and Indirect Effects of a Sex‐Biased Antagonist on Male and Female Fertility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/513150","volume":"169"},{"id":"astleyCategoricalDiscriminationGeneralization","author":[{"family":"Astley","given":"Suzette L"},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A"}],"citation-key":"astleyCategoricalDiscriminationGeneralization","language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Categorical Discrimination and Generalization in Pigeons: All Negative Stimuli Are Not Created Equal","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"astleyNoveltyFunctionalEquivalence1998","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Astley","given":"Suzette L."},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"astleyNoveltyFunctionalEquivalence1998","container-title":"Animal Learning & Behavior","container-title-short":"Animal Learning & Behavior","DOI":"10.3758/BF03199206","ISSN":"0090-4996, 1532-5830","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",6]]},"language":"en","page":"125-138","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Novelty and functional equivalence in superordinate categorization by pigeons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/BF03199206","volume":"26"},{"id":"auerspergExplorationTechniqueTechnical2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Auersperg","given":"Alice M.I."}],"citation-key":"auerspergExplorationTechniqueTechnical2015","container-title":"Animal Creativity and Innovation","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-800648-1.00003-6","ISBN":"978-0-12-800648-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"45-72","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exploration Technique and Technical Innovations in Corvids and Parrots","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780128006481000036"},{"id":"austElementalConfiguralPerception2003","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Aust","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Ludwig"}],"citation-key":"austElementalConfiguralPerception2003","container-title":"Animal Learning & Behavior","container-title-short":"Animal Learning & Behavior","DOI":"10.3758/BF03195984","ISSN":"0090-4996, 1532-5830","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",8]]},"language":"en","page":"213-224","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Elemental versus configural perception in a people-present/people-absent discrimination task by pigeons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/BF03195984","volume":"31"},{"id":"austPictureObjectRecognition2006","author":[{"family":"Aust","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Ludwig"}],"citation-key":"austPictureObjectRecognition2006","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes","DOI":"10.1037/0097-7403.32.2.190","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"190","source":"Zotero","title":"Picture–Object Recognition in Pigeons: Evidence of Representational Insight in a Visual Categorization Task Using a Complementary Information Procedure","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},{"id":"austRepresentationalInsightPigeons2010","abstract":"Understanding the relation between objects and their pictures at a level beyond mere feature discrimination is by no means a trivial cognitive ability, and support of this is still weak in nonhuman species.

The study investigates the conditions under which a hamadryas male 'rival' respects a pair consisting of a male 'owner' and his female rather than fighting the owner and attempting to appropriate the female. Two types of laboratory experiments were carried out on a colony of six males and six females: (a) choice tests that yielded a score of preference of each female for each male and of each male for each female, and (b) tests that measured the tendency of the rival to respect a pair in a given triad. The following results were obtained: (1) The respect of the rival was not correlated with the preference of the owner or of the rival for the particular female. (2) The respect of middle- and low-ranking rivals was positively correlated with the preference of the female for the owner. The two males highest in rank did not adhere to this strategy. 2. These results are functionally interpreted in terms of an asymmetric 'payoff' of the female to the males. Under a given dominance relationship (or asymmetry of resource holding potential) between the two males, a female with a strong preference for her present owner is too costly a prize for the rival in terms of herding effort and the risk of losing her again. However, if a rival is informed that the female will not choose her present owner, his attack may temporarily free her from the owner's herding and permit her to exert her choice in favor of the rival. The strategy seems particularly adaptive in males that cannot play out their superior rank. The causal interpretation is that baboons may be capable of assessing aspects of a relationship among two other members of their group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bachmann","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Kummer","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"bachmannMaleAssessmentFemale1980","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","ISSN":"0340-5443","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]},"page":"315-321","publisher":"Springer","source":"JSTOR","title":"Male Assessment of Female Choice in Hamadryas Baboons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4599295","volume":"6"},{"id":"baileyIndirectGeneticEffects2018","abstract":"Behavior is rapidly flexible and highly context-dependent, which poses obvious challenges to researchers attempting to dissect its causes. However, over a century of unresolved debate has also focused on whether the very flexibility and context-dependence of behavior lends it a unique role in the evolutionary origins and patterns of diversity in the Animal Kingdom. Here, we propose that both challenges can benefit from studying how indirect genetic effects (IGEs: the effects of genes expressed in one individual on traits in another individual) shape behavioral phenotypes. We provide a sketch of the theoretical framework that grounds IGEs in behavioral ecology research and focus on recent advances made from studies of IGEs in areas of behavioral ecology such as sexual selection, sexual conflict, social dominance, and parent–offspring interactions. There is mounting evidence that IGEs have important influences on behavioral phenotypes associated with these processes, such as sexual signals and preferences and behaviors which function to manipulate interacting partners. IGEs can also influence both responses to selection and selection itself, and considering IGEs refines evolutionary predictions and provides new perspectives on the origins of seemingly perplexing behavioral traits. A key unresolved question, but one that has dominated the behavioral sciences for over a century, is whether behavior is more likely than other types of traits to contribute to evolutionary change and diversification. We advocate taking advantage of an IGE approach to outline falsifiable hypotheses and a general methodology to rigorously test this frequently proposed, yet still contentious, special role of behavior in evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bailey","given":"Nathan W"},{"family":"Marie-Orleach","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Allen J"}],"citation-key":"baileyIndirectGeneticEffects2018","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arx127","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,13]]},"page":"1-11","source":"Silverchair","title":"Indirect genetic effects in behavioral ecology: does behavior play a special role in evolution?","title-short":"Indirect genetic effects in behavioral ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arx127","volume":"29"},{"id":"baileyPhysicalCognitionBirds2014","author":[{"family":"Bailey","given":"Ida E"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Kate V"},{"family":"Bertin","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Meddle","given":"Simone L"},{"family":"Healy","given":"Susan D"}],"citation-key":"baileyPhysicalCognitionBirds2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.3225","issue":"1784","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"20133225","source":"Zotero","title":"Physical cognition: birds learn the structural efficacy of nest material","type":"article-journal","volume":"281"},{"id":"baileySociallyFlexibleFemale2012","abstract":"Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one individual affect the phenotype of a conspecific. Theoretical models indicate that the evolutionary consequences of IGEs critically depend on the genetic architecture of interacting traits, and on the strength and direction of phenotypic effects arising from social interactions, which can be quantified by the interaction coefficient Ψ. In the context of sexually selected traits, strong positive Ψ tends to exaggerate evolutionary change, whereas negative Ψ impedes sexual trait elaboration. Despite its theoretical importance, whether and how Ψ varies among geographically distinct populations is unknown. Such information is necessary to evaluate the potential for IGEs to contribute to divergence among isolated or semi-isolated populations. Here, we report substantial variation in Ψ for a behavioural trait involved in sexual selection in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus: female choosiness. Both the strength and direction of Ψ varied among geographically isolated populations. Ψ also changed over time. In a contemporary population of crickets from Kauai, experience of male song increased female choosiness. In contrast, experience of male song decreased choosiness in an ancestral population from the same location. This rapid change corroborates studies examining the evolvability of Ψ and demonstrates how interpopulation variation in the interaction coefficient might influence sexual selection and accelerate divergence of traits influenced by IGEs that contribute to reproductive isolation in nascent species or subspecies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bailey","given":"Nathan W."},{"family":"Zuk","given":"Marlene"}],"citation-key":"baileySociallyFlexibleFemale2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2012.0631","issue":"1742","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,30]]},"page":"3589-3596","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Socially flexible female choice differs among populations of the Pacific field cricket: geographical variation in the interaction coefficient psi (Ψ)","title-short":"Socially flexible female choice differs among populations of the Pacific field cricket","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.0631","volume":"279"},{"id":"baileyUsingDifferentBody2020","abstract":"Aim Declining animal body size has been proposed as a general response to increasing global temperatures that should be observed across a broad biogeographical scale. However, published studies have shown large variation in both the magnitude and direction of body size trends. We aim to investigate how the way body size is measured (body mass, structural size, body condition) may contribute to differences in body size trends between studies. Location Semi-arid Australia. Taxon White-plumed honeyeater (Ptilotula penicillatus). Methods We studied two separate populations of P. penicillatus over 30 years to investigate the associations between weather and body size. We first investigated how body mass has been affected by weather conditions at each site and then determined how these same local weather conditions affected the constituent components of body mass (structural size and body condition). Results The magnitude and direction of weather effects differed with the measure of body size used. Average structural size (wing length) increased with increasing temperatures while average body condition decreased. As body mass is a composite of structural size and body condition, the magnitude and direction of body mass trends was affected by trends in these two other traits. For example, differences in temperature effects on structural size between our two sites led to clear differences in body mass trends. Main Conclusions Trends in body size will be strongly affected by the choice of body size measure used in analyses. Change in body mass can be particularly difficult to interpret as it will be a composite of changes in both structural size and body condition. Our results indicate that it is difficult to compare studies using different measures of body size.

Some bird species live in social groups and perform territorial advertisement song as a group. Group singing raises questions concerning its function in the social life of the group. Australian magpies (Cracticus tibicen = Gymnorhina tibicen) are group-living birds that sing chorus songs known as carols. Each carol is composed of a series of individual syllables. Previous spectrographic descriptions of carols in eastern Australian populations found individual-specific and sex-specific acoustic characteristics in carol syllables and group-specific characteristics in carol songs. These findings suggest that carols might reveal not only the identity of the group, but also other properties, such as its size and sex composition, which could influence outcomes in assessment/management interactions between groups. I tape-recorded and analyzed carols of seven magpie groups in Western Australia, a location and subspecies (C. t. dorsalis) differing from the previous studies of singing by magpies. I analyzed carols of each group to determine acoustic features of syllables, syllable syntax within carols and the way carols are delivered as a repertoire. Visual classification of individual song syllables as seen on sound spectrograms, automated quantification of spectral features of song syllables, examination for carol repertoires and call-answer syntax within carols all revealed little evidence that magpies have individual-specific or group-specific vocal characteristics. Thus, chorus songs do not appear sufficiently distinctive to communicate identity at the level of the group nor reveal group size and composition. Instead, caroling may signal only territory occupancy and willingness to participate in territorial defense. A new hypothesis is advanced suggesting that chorus songs of group-living birds are an unselected consequence of the coordinated duet songs of the breeding male and female whose duets are joined adventitiously by other group members.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Myron C."}],"citation-key":"bakerInformationContentChorus2009","container-title":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01606.x","ISSN":"1439-0310","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"227-238","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Information Content in Chorus Songs of the Group-Living Australian Magpie (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis) in Western Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01606.x","volume":"115"},{"id":"bakerPopulationDifferentiationComplex2003","abstract":"We examined three bioacoustical analysis methods for comparing complex sounds among diﬀerent populations. We chose the D-syllable of the chick-a-dee call of the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapilla) because it is a broadband sound representative of a class of vocalizations, common in many animals, that resists simple subjective classiﬁcation for comparative studies. We examined the properties of the D-syllable in ﬁeld-recorded samples from three diﬀerent populations. The ﬁrst method of data extraction sampled the amplitude values of a spectrum obtained in a single fast Fourier transform (SFFT) taken at the midpoint of each D-syllable using multi-speech software. The second method employed spectrogram cross-correlation (SPCC) to obtain a matrix of similarity values between D-syllables in the samples using canary software. The third method calculated similarity values obtained from the evaluation of four acoustic features of the D-syllables derived from multi-taper spectral analysis (MTSA) using sound analysis software. Following data extraction by these three techniques, we used multivariate statistical procedures to reduce the data for examination of diﬀerences among populations and to represent in scatter-plots the patterns of clustering of the sounds. We found that the SFFT in the middle of the D-syllable provided the poorest population discrimination following statistical processing, the SPCC method produced the next clearest population separation, and the MTSA method resulted in the most distinct separation of the three populations of D-syllables. In carrying out these comparisons, we discovered that the characteristic environmental noise of a recording area can inﬂuence the signal properties of broadband sounds being compared by automated procedures, and could lead to faulty conclusions unless appropriate care is taken to mitigate the noise in which the signals of interest are embedded. Consequently we re-analyzed our data following noise reduction and found less discrete population separation overall. However, the methods of SPCC and MTSA retained the ability to separate populations, with MTSA providing the sharpest discrimination among groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Myron C."},{"family":"Logue","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"bakerPopulationDifferentiationComplex2003","container-title":"Ethology","container-title-short":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1439-0310.2003.00866.x","ISSN":"0179-1613, 1439-0310","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",3]]},"language":"en","page":"223-242","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Population Differentiation in a Complex Bird Sound: A Comparison of Three Bioacoustical Analysis Procedures","title-short":"Population Differentiation in a Complex Bird Sound","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1046/j.1439-0310.2003.00866.x","volume":"109"},{"id":"ballEthologicalConceptsRevisited2001","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ball","given":"G.F."},{"family":"Balthazart","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"ballEthologicalConceptsRevisited2001","container-title":"Brain, Behavior and Evolution","container-title-short":"Brain Behav Evol","DOI":"10.1159/000047244","ISSN":"0006-8977, 1421-9743","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","page":"252-270","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ethological Concepts Revisited: Immediate Early Gene Induction in Response to Sexual Stimuli in Birds","title-short":"Ethological Concepts Revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/47244","volume":"57"},{"id":"balsbySexspecificResponsesVocal2008","abstract":"We investigated the signal function of vocal imitation of contact calls in orange-fronted conures (OFCs; Aratinga canicularis) in Costa Rica.

During call exchanges, the similarity between the contact calls of different individuals may either increase (converge) or decrease (diverge). We conducted a playback experiment on wild-caught captive birds in which we simulated convergent, divergent and no-change interaction series with male and female contact calls. OFCs responded differently to convergent and divergent series of contact calls, but only when we considered the sex of the test birds. Males called most in response to convergent series, whereas females demonstrated high calling rates in response to both convergent and divergent interactions. Both sexes responded most to contact calls from the opposite sex, but overall females produced more calls and had shorter latencies to calling than males. These results demonstrate that OFCs can discriminate between male and female contact calls and that subtle changes in contact call structure during interactions have signal function. The stronger overall response to convergent series suggests that convergence of contact calls is an affiliative signal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten J.S"},{"family":"Scarl","given":"Judith C"}],"citation-key":"balsbySexspecificResponsesVocal2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2008.0517","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1647","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,22]]},"page":"2147-2154","PMCID":"PMC2603217","PMID":"18522908","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Sex-specific responses to vocal convergence and divergence of contact calls in orange-fronted conures (Aratinga canicularis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2603217/","volume":"275"},{"id":"balsbyVocalImitationParrots2012","abstract":"Parrots in captivity are known for their ability to vocally imitate humans and recently it has been shown that wild-living orange-fronted conures are able to immediately imitate other individuals’ contact calls. The function of this exceptional ability to imitate remains unclear. However, orange–fronted conures live in fission-fusion flocks where they encounter many different individuals every day, and it is possible that their vocal imitation ability is a flexible means to address a specific individual within a flock. We tested this via playback to short-term captive wild conures. Test birds were placed together in pairs in outdoor aviaries to form simple flocks. To simulate imitation of a specific individual these pairs received playback of contact calls that primarily imitate one of the two birds. Overall, individuals that received simulated vocal imitations of its calls responded more frequently and faster than the other individual. This suggests that orange-fronted conures can use imitations of contact calls to address specific individuals of a flock. In the discussion we argue that the fission-fusion flock dynamics of many parrot species has been an important factor in evolving conures’ and other parrots’ exceptional ability to imitate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten J.

The functions of vocal matching are less well understood in fission/fusion species that are non-territorial, live in groups with variable composition, and lack multiple alarm signals. Here we present the results of interactive playbacks in a fission/fusion parrot species, the orange-fronted conjure (Aratinga canicularis), that provide evidence of vocal matching. A randomly selected loud contact call (chee) per trial was played to passing wild flocks and short-term captives in Costa Rica. Of the trials where subjects interacted, 30% of wild flocks and 21% of captive trials showed significantly linear or curvilinear changes in similarity between the stimulus and response chees over the course of the trial. Surprisingly, both convergent and divergent sequences were observed, and many trials lacking a single trend showed disjunct changes in stimulus–response similarity. These results suggest that chee exchanges prior to flock fusions are not simply an exchange of greetings but are more likely some form of negotiation. This would explain the presence of convergent, divergent, and variable patterns of stimulus–response similarity seen in our experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten J.

An individual’s decision to call to another could be determined by previous interactions with that individual, which would require individuals to be able to discriminate others based on their vocalizations and associate knowledge with their vocal identity. Alternatively, this decision may be determined solely by the current interaction. In a playback experiment, we tested the ability of orange-fronted conures, Aratinga canicularis to discriminate between calls of familiar and unfamiliar females. Males were able to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar calls from different females. Furthermore, test birds seemed to associate experience from the previous interaction with the vocal characteristics of the familiar call, but this result was marginally nonsignificant. The success of the playback in imitating the test bird’s contact call in the current interaction proved important, as high similarity between playback and the test bird’s contact calls elicited a stronger response from it. The importance of call imitation during current interactions probably reflects the fact that orange-fronted conures live in flocks with fission–fusion dynamics and therefore often interact with unfamiliar individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten J.

It has recently been suggested that biases in information processing may offer a novel means of understanding animal emotions. Anxious and depressed people tend to interpret ambiguous information negatively. We explored the proposal that such cognitive biases also exist in non-human animals and could therefore be used as novel measures of animal welfare. We used a novel cognitive bias task based on a learnt taste aversion to determine whether birds deprived of environmental enrichment show biases in their classification of ambiguous signals. We hypothesised that starlings in enriched cages should be more likely to classify ambiguous signals as being associated with a positive outcome than starlings housed in standard, unenriched cages. Starlings were trained on a go/no-go procedure to discriminate between two visual stimuli (cardboard lids of white and dark grey) associated with outcomes of a different value (palatable and unpalatable mealworms hidden underneath). Individual birds’ responses to unreinforced, intermediate stimuli (various shades of grey between white and dark grey) were subsequently examined while each bird was housed sequentially in both standard and enriched cages. The probability of a bird classifying an ambiguous pale grey lid as hiding a palatable mealworm was lower in standard cages than enriched cages, but this difference was found only in birds that received enriched cages first. Our results can be interpreted as showing a pessimistic bias in birds that have recently experienced a decline in environmental quality. These findings support the use of cognitive bias-based tasks as a novel, non-invasive technique for assessing welfare in non-human animals.","author":[{"family":"Bateson","given":"M"},{"family":"Matheson","given":"SM"}],"citation-key":"batesonPerformanceCategorisationTask2007","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"4","source":"Zotero","title":"Performance on a categorisation task suggests that removal of environmental enrichment induces ‘pessimism’ in captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"baudIndirectGeneticEffects2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            Indirect genetic effects (IGE) occur when an individual’s phenotype is influenced by genetic variation in conspecifics.

Both naïve and experienced birds should thus react to such stimuli with fear reactions. However, studies on different species have shown the importance of experience in the development of these fear reactions. We hypothesized that the responses of adult European starlings to fear-inducing visual stimuli may differ according to experience. We compared the reactions of Hand-raised adults with no experience of predators to those of Wild-caught adults, with potentially extensive experience with predators. Three visual stimuli (i.e. human, raptor, snake) were broadcast to 17 birds as 2D pictures (displayed via a LCD screen) with different modalities of presentation: degree of proximity and with or without movement. The results reveal that the birds were particularly sensitive to proximity and movement, with more attention towards moving stimuli and more withdrawal for close stimuli. The human stimulus elicited attention in both the distant and moving modalities but, like the other stimuli, mostly withdrawal when it was close. Developmental experience appeared to influence the emotional level, as the Hand-raised birds reacted strongly to all stimuli and all modalities, contrarily to the WC birds which performed withdrawals almost only for close stimuli and attention to moving stimuli. Stimuli proximity and movement seemed, therefore, relevant features that elicited negative reactions in Wild-caught birds. The Hand-raised birds were equally attentive to both distant and moving stimuli. Thus the young birds showed no real discrimination. Early and later experiences may, therefore, influence birds’ reactions. Starlings may require experience with real threats to develop adaptive responses, i.e. limiting unnecessary loss of energy by fleeing in front of non-dangerous stimuli.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Belin","given":"Laurine"},{"family":"Formanek","given":"Laureline"},{"family":"Heyraud","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"},{"family":"Henry","given":"Laurence"}],"citation-key":"belinInfluenceEarlyExperience2018","container-title":"Animal Cognition","container-title-short":"Anim Cogn","DOI":"10.1007/s10071-018-1207-x","ISSN":"1435-9456","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,21]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Influence of early experience on processing 2D threatening pictures by European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-018-1207-x"},{"id":"benjaminiControlFalseDiscovery2001","abstract":"Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems.

We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties.

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power.

The body size was used as the cue only for the discrimination of the robin-coloured dummies.

We test whether the number of helpers in early life and over the dominance tenure length has an impact on litter size at weaning, juvenile survival, longevity and lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of dominant females. Dominant females, who were born into a group containing many helpers and experiencing a high number of accumulated helpers over dominance tenure length showed an increased LRS through an increased longevity. We provide evidence that in a wild vertebrate, both early and adult social environments influence individual fitness, acting additionally and independently.

Although reproductive allocation declined, post-weaning juvenile survival and the size–number trade-off did not change markedly throughout a female's lifetime. Senescence of annual reproductive success (i.e., the number of offspring surviving their first hibernation within a given litter) only resulted from senescence of litter size. The data were insufficient to determine whether the decrease in litter size with age was caused by declining litter size at birth, offspring pre-weaning survival, or both. Regardless, our findings demonstrate that marmot females display a size–number trade-off invariant with age, and that their reproductive tactic involves increasing offspring size at the cost of decreasing litter size with increasing age.

We studied vocal ontogeny in nests of wild green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) in Venezuela. We identified three successive phases of vocal signaling that corresponded closely to three independently derived phases of physiological development. For each ontogenetic phase, we characterized the relative importance of anatomical constraints, motor skills necessary for responding to specific contexts of the immediate environment, and the learning of signals that are necessary for adult forms of communication. We observed shifts in the relative importance of these three factors as individuals progressed from one stage to the next; there was no single fixed ratio of factors that applied across the entire ontogenetic sequence. The earliest vocalizations were short in duration, as predicted from physical constraints and under-developed motor control. Calls became longer and frequency modulated during intermediate nestling ages in line with motor skills required for competitive begging. In the week before fledging, calls drastically shortened in accordance with the flight-constrained short durations of adult contact calls. The latter constraints were made evident by the demonstrated links between wing-assisted incline running, a widespread prelude to avian flight, just before the shift from longduration begging calls to short-duration contact calls. At least in this species, the shifting emphases of factors at different ontogenetic stages precluded the morphing of intermediate-stage begging calls into adult contact calls; as shown previously, the latter are influenced by sample templates provided by parents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Berg","given":"Karl S."},{"family":"Beissinger","given":"Steven R."},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Jack W."}],"citation-key":"bergFactorsShapingOntogeny2013","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","container-title-short":"J Exp Biol","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.073502","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"338-345","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Factors shaping the ontogeny of vocal signals in a wild parrot","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jeb.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.073502","volume":"216"},{"id":"bergVerticalTransmissionLearned2012","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Berg","given":"Karl S."},{"family":"Delgado","given":"Soraya"},{"family":"Cortopassi","given":"Kathryn A."},{"family":"Beissinger","given":"Steven R."},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Jack W."}],"citation-key":"bergVerticalTransmissionLearned2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

We used a classical method of maternal deprivation. Ethological tests and observations analysed and compared the behaviour of young artificially raised quail to that of young raised by adoptive maternal quail. After separation from mothers, brooded young were more fearful (frightened easily) in the presence of humans (human-observer tests) and more neophobic in novel environments (open-field and hole-in-the-wall tests) than young raised artificially. As chicks rarely expressed fear during the brooding period, no differences related to mothering could be observed at that time. In separation tests, brooded chicks jumped significantly more frequently than non-brooded chicks and later, observations of groups revealed that brooded chicks remained closer to one another than non-brooded chicks. Social motivation of brooded chicks appeared to be higher. These results indicate that, during their first days of life, mothers influence the emotional and social behaviour of their young. J. Exp.

Climatic variability is likely to cause large inter-annual variation in the frequency of extra-pair litters produced, a widespread alternative mating tactic to help prevent, correct or minimize the negative consequences of sub-optimal mate choice. In this study, we investigated how climatic variability affects the inter-annual variation in the proportion of extra-pair litters in a wild population of Alpine marmots. During 22 years of monitoring, the annual proportion of extra-pair litters directly increased with the onset of earlier springs and indirectly with increased snow in winters. Snowier winters resulted in a higher proportion of families with sexually mature male subordinates and thus, created a social context within which extra-pair paternity was favoured. Earlier spring snowmelt could create this pattern by relaxing energetic, movement and time constraints. Further, deeper snow in winter could also contribute by increasing litter size and juvenile survival. Optimal mate choice is particularly relevant to generate adaptive genetic diversity. Understanding the influence of environmental conditions and the capacity of the individuals to cope with them is crucial within the context of rapid climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bichet","given":"Coraline"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Sauzet","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"}],"citation-key":"bichetFaithfulNotDirect2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2016.2240","issue":"1845","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,28]]},"page":"20162240","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Faithful or not: direct and indirect effects of climate on extra-pair paternities in a population of Alpine marmots","title-short":"Faithful or not","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.2240","volume":"283"},{"id":"bijmaGeneralDefinitionHeritable2011","abstract":"Genetic selection is a major force shaping life on earth.

We apply these methods to obtain estimates of genetic parameters for survival days in a population of layer chickens with high mortality due to pecking behavior.

As a consequence, predicted responses to multilevel selection applied to this population are threefold greater than classical predictions.

Although quantitative genetics has successfully been applied to many traits, it does not provide a general theory accounting for interaction among individuals and selection acting on multiple levels. Consequently, current quantitative genetic theory fails to explain why some traits do not respond to selection among individuals, but respond greatly to selection among groups. Understanding the full impacts of heritable interactions on the outcomes of selection requires a quantitative genetic framework including all levels of selection and relatedness. Here we present such a framework and provide expressions for the response to selection. Results show that interaction among individuals may create substantial heritable variation, which is hidden to classical analyses. Selection acting on higher levels of organization captures this hidden variation and therefore always yields positive response, whereas individual selection may yield response in the opposite direction.

IGEs can have profound effects on both the magnitude and the direction of response to selection. Models of inheritance and response to selection in traits subject to IGEs have been developed within two frameworks; a trait-based framework in which IGEs are specified as a direct consequence of individual trait values, and a variance-component framework in which phenotypic variance is decomposed into a direct and an indirect additive genetic component. This work is a selective review of the quantitative genetics of traits affected by IGEs, with a focus on modelling, estimation and interpretation issues. It includes a discussion on variance-component vs trait-based models of IGEs, a review of issues related to the estimation of IGEs from field data, including the estimation of the interaction coefficient Ψ (psi), and a discussion on the relevance of IGEs for response to selection in cases where the strength of interaction varies among pairs of individuals. An investigation of the trait-based model shows that the interaction coefficient Ψ may deviate considerably from the corresponding regression coefficient when feedback occurs. The increasing research effort devoted to IGEs suggests that they are a widespread phenomenon, probably particularly in natural populations and plants.

We presented the rooks with two different stimuli of the same category and recorded the amount of time they observed each stimulus. Rooks preferred to look at a live bird, static or video image of a bird, and a stuffed model over an empty compartment. Rooks also showed a clear preference for a strongly affiliated conspecific (e.g. their partner) over a nonaffiliated conspecific.

This has been dubbed Bergmann's rule in his honour. However, more than 150 years on, we appear to be little closer to a general understanding of the rule, or even to any consensus as to whether it exists. This is due in large part to confusion about the taxonomic level at which the rule is considered to operate, and to the conflation of pattern and mechanism. In this paper, we attempt to resolve this confusion by highlighting its sources, and by providing a definition of Bergmann's rule that is practical and useful, yet that retains the essential features of its original formulation. We conclude by briefly reviewing the mechanisms proposed to explain Bergmann's rule as we define it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Blackburn","given":"Tim M."},{"family":"Gaston","given":"Kevin J."},{"family":"Loder","given":"Natasha"}],"citation-key":"blackburnGeographicGradientsBody1999","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1046/j.1472-4642.1999.00046.x","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","page":"165-174","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Geographic gradients in body size: a clarification of Bergmann's rule","title-short":"Geographic gradients in body size","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1472-4642.1999.00046.x","volume":"5"},{"id":"blakeEvolvingStaySame2023","abstract":"Food drives ecology and evolution, but few studies have directly investigated the impacts of the total amount of food on life history evolution within-species. Among the limited number of available case studies that do directly test total food effects on life history evolution we still lack consensus, partially owing to incompletely described life histories. We explored life history tradeoffs across the whole life cycle, and the consequences for trait and population dynamics, in a marine copepod evolved under high and low total food using an integral projection model (IPM). Populations were subjected to high- and low-food regimes and a common garden experiment after 30 generations of evolution. We then sampled and measured individual vital rates (growth, reproduction, and survival) from hatching until death, which were used to parameterise IPMs. Food regime had a significant but slight effect on life histories, which appeared ‘slow' and ‘fast' in low-food and high-food lineages, respectively. Low-food lineages grew bigger and produced larger offspring to genetically compensate for their environment, but this compensation came with costs; notably shorter lifespans and less chance of producing clutches of eggs. Despite these differences, population ecology and fitness were similar in high- and low-food lineages as anticipated by per-capita rather than total food effects. Consequently, though natural planktonic populations may genetically mitigate the effects of climate-induced food scarcity, there are limits to this compensation and likely unforeseen impacts effects for wider food webs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Blake","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Coulson","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"blakeEvolvingStaySame2023","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/oik.10161","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"e10161","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evolving to stay the same: life history evolution and tradeoffs in response to high and low total food","title-short":"Evolving to stay the same","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.10161","volume":"2023"},{"id":"bleiLatentDirichletAllocation","abstract":"We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora.

We examined the concordance of spatial patterns with temporal body-size change since the last glacial maximum (LGM). Location California, western North America. Methods We quantified body size of modern populations of ground squirrels (n = 81) and used a model-selection approach to determine the best variables (sex, vegetation, number of congeners, temperature and/or precipitation) explaining geographical variation in body size among modern populations. We also quantified body size of one fossil population in northern California (n = 39) and compared temporal body-size change in S. beecheyi at this location since the LGM with model predictions. Results Body size of modern populations conformed to Bergmann’s rule, with larger individuals in northern (wetter and cooler) portions of California. However, the models suggest that precipitation, rather than temperature or other variables, may best explain variation in body size across modern spatial gradients. Our conclusion is supported by the temporal data, demonstrating that the body size of S. beecheyi has increased in northern California since the LGM, concordant with precipitation but not temperature change in the region. Main conclusions Precipitation, rather than temperature, vegetation or number of congeneric species, was the main factor explaining both spatial and temporal patterns of body-size variation in S. beecheyi. The integration of space and time provides a powerful mechanism for predicting how local populations may respond to current and future climatic changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Blois","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Feranec","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Hadly","given":"Elizabeth A."}],"citation-key":"bloisEnvironmentalInfluencesSpatial2008","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01836.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2007 The Authors","page":"602-613","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Environmental influences on spatial and temporal patterns of body-size variation in California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01836.x","volume":"35"},{"id":"bloomfieldCategorizationDiscriminationChickadee2008","abstract":"Bloomfield and Sturdy [Bloomfield, L.L., Sturdy, C.B.

Comparison of neonatal production with ingestion and assimilation suggests that larger mammals put proportionately less effort into reproduction.

This is largely due to the difficulty of demonstrating a fundamental prerequisite for the existence of culture: social learning. As the only case where social learning has been demonstrated conclusively, and subsequently linked to spatial or temporal trait variation, avian vocal dialects are the best studied, and most widely accepted, form of animal culture. Here, we investigate the potential for vocal culture in one of the few animals for which material culture has been suggested: the New Caledonian crow Corvus moneduloides. We show that this species: (1) possesses the capacity for social learning of vocalizations (experimental evidence in the form of a captive subject that reproduces human speech and other anthropogenic noises); and (2) exhibits significant large-scale, population-level variation in its vocalizations (cross-island playback experiments, with analyses controlling for a substantial set of potentially confounding variables). In combination, this provides strong evidence for the existence of ‘culture’ in these birds. More specifically, our findings reveal that the species exhibits sufficient social learning mechanisms, and within-population structuring, to generate and perpetuate cultural variation in at least one behavioural domain. This is a critical first step towards demonstrating cultural transmission in other behaviours, including tool manufacture and tool use, opening the door for the simultaneous investigation of vocal and material culture in a nonhuman species. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 101, 767–776.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bluff","given":"Lucas A."},{"family":"Kacelnik","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Rutz","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"bluffVocalCultureNew2010","container-title":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","DOI":"10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01527.x","ISSN":"1095-8312","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"767-776","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Vocal culture in New Caledonian crows Corvus moneduloides","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01527.x","volume":"101"},{"id":"blumsteinSocialConsequencesRapid2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Blumstein","given":"Daniel T."},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Loren D."},{"family":"Pinter-Wollman","given":"Noa"}],"citation-key":"blumsteinSocialConsequencesRapid2023","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.tree.2022.11.005","ISSN":"0169-5347","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"language":"English","page":"337-345","PMID":"36473809","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"www.cell.com","title":"Social consequences of rapid environmental change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(22)00285-3","volume":"38"},{"id":"blumsteinSocialConsequencesRapid2023a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Blumstein","given":"Daniel T."},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Loren D."},{"family":"Pinter-Wollman","given":"Noa"}],"citation-key":"blumsteinSocialConsequencesRapid2023a","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.tree.2022.11.005","ISSN":"01695347","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"337-345","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social consequences of rapid environmental change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534722002853","volume":"38"},{"id":"boakeQuantitativeGeneticStudies1994","abstract":"Quantitative genetics—the statistical study of the inheritance of traits within a population—has become an important tool for studying the evolution of behavior in the last decade.

Christine R. B. Boake brings together current theoretical and empirical studies to show how quantitative genetics can illuminate topics as diverse as sexual selection, migration, sociality, and aggressive behavior. Nearly half of the chapters focus on conceptual issues, ranging from quantitative genetic models to the complementary roles of quantitative genetic and optimality approaches in evolutionary studies. Other chapters illustrate how to use the techniques by providing surveys of research fields, such as the evolution of mating behavior, sexual selection, migration, and size-dependent behavioral variation. The balance of the volume offers case studies of territoriality in fruit flies, cannibalism in flour beetles, mate-attractive traits in crickets, locomotor behavior and physiology in the garter snake, and cold adaptation in the house mouse. Taken together, these studies document both the benefits and pitfalls of quantitative genetics.

In birds, discriminating between conspecifics based on individual characteristics has been tested mainly in the auditory domain with territorial calls and songs for neighbour and kin discrimination but little is known about discriminating between signallers in food calls. Ravens utilize a large set of calls and show individually distinctive call repertoires. Moreover, they show advanced social tactics during foraging, suggesting that they are capable of dealing with conspecifics on an individual basis. When confronted with food that is difficult to access, ravens produce particular calls (‘haa’, yells); these calls attract other ravens and, thus, have been hypothesized to serve as ‘functionally referential signals’. We here examined whether ravens are able to differentiate between individuals on the basis of these food calls. We first analysed individual differences in call parameters, using 424 food calls recorded from 18 individually marked wild ravens in the Austrian Alps. We then tested 18 captive ravens for recognition of individual differences in food calls with playbacks, using a habituation-dishabituation design. We found evidence that food calls show individual call characteristics in fundamental frequency and intensity-related measurements providing ravens with the opportunity to respond according to these individually distinct features. Furthermore, ravens discriminated between unfamiliar ravens in the habituation-dishabituation experiment, indicating that they may discern individual differences. Our results suggest that raven food calls are individually distinct and that the birds may be capable of differentiating between food-calling individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Boeckle","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Szipl","given":"Georgine"},{"family":"Bugnyar","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"boeckleWhoWantsFood2012","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.08.011","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1123-1130","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Who wants food?

Canonical correlation analysis revealed a gradient in the form of the kee-ah call in both adults and juveniles along and across the escarpment of the Southern Alps, the primary longitudinal mountain range on the South Island of New Zealand. Although the juvenile call varies geographically along the same axes as the adult version, the aspects of the call that vary geographically are strikingly different, suggesting that the variation results from independent processes of vocal learning in the two age classes. A similar analysis of squeal vocalizations, which are only produced by juveniles, found even greater levels of geographic variation. We suggest that the immediate social environment may serve as the primary factor shaping the vocal patterns of both juveniles and adults, producing localized homogeneity in call form within each age class.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bond","given":"Alan B."},{"family":"Diamond","given":"Judy"}],"citation-key":"bondGeographicOntogeneticVariation2005","container-title":"Behaviour","container-title-short":"Behav","DOI":"10.1163/1568539053627721","ISSN":"0005-7959, 1568-539X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-20","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Geographic and ontogenetic variation in the contact calls of the kea (Nestor notabilis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/142/1/article-p1_1.xml","volume":"142"},{"id":"bondSocialComplexityTransitive2003","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bond","given":"Alan B."},{"family":"Kamil","given":"Alan C."},{"family":"Balda","given":"Russell P."}],"citation-key":"bondSocialComplexityTransitive2003","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1006/anbe.2003.2101","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","page":"479-487","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social complexity and transitive inference in corvids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347203921014","volume":"65"},{"id":"bonnetBiggerFitterQuantitative2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonnet","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Wandeler","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Camenisch","given":"Glauco"},{"family":"Postma","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"bonnetBiggerFitterQuantitative2017","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLoS Biol","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.1002592","editor":[{"family":"Bonduriansky","given":"Russell"}],"ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e1002592","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bigger Is Fitter?

Asocial learning performance, measured in isolation, predicted who was the first solver of the novel foraging tasks in each group. Association patterns did not predict the spread of solving. Contact latency and solving duration were negatively correlated, consistent with social learning underlying the spread of solving.

Therefore, Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility could be an important factor promoting rapid speciation in invertebrates5, although this contention is controversial6,7.

The presence of Wolbachia severely reduces the frequency of hybrid offspring in interspecies crosses. However, antibiotic curing of the insects results in production of hybrids. Furthermore, F1 and F2 hybrids are completely viable and fertile, indicating the absence of F1 and F2 hybrid breakdown. Partial interspecific sexual isolation occurs, yet it is asymmetric and incomplete.

Here we develop a model that explores these issues and use it to study how changes in the timescale and predictability of environmental variation may ultimately affect population viability. Our model indicates that, although populations can often cope with fairly large changes in these environmental parameters, on occasion they will collapse abruptly and go extinct.

Here we develop a unifying model that predicts evolutionary responses to environmentally driven fluctuating selection and use this theoretical framework to explore the potential consequences of altered environmental cycles. We first show that the parameter space determined by different combinations of predictability and timescale of environmental variation is partitioned into distinct regions where a single mode of response (reversible phenotypic plasticity, irreversible phenotypic plasticity, bet-hedging, or adaptive tracking) has a clear selective advantage over all others. We then demonstrate that, although significant environmental changes within these regions can be accommodated by evolution, most changes that involve transitions between regions result in rapid population collapse and often extinction. Thus, the boundaries between response mode regions in our model correspond to evolutionary tipping points, where even minor changes in environmental parameters can have dramatic and disproportionate consequences on population viability. Finally, we discuss how different life histories and genetic architectures may influence the location of tipping points in parameter space and the likelihood of extinction during such transitions. These insights can help identify and address some of the cryptic threats to natural populations that are likely to result from any natural or human-induced change in environmental conditions. They also demonstrate the potential value of evolutionary thinking in the study of global climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Botero","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Weissing","given":"Franz J."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Rubenstein","given":"Dustin R."}],"citation-key":"boteroEvolutionaryTippingPoints2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

Various explanations have been suggested for these mismatches. These include within-individual changes across lifespan that can create important variation in genetic architecture of traits and selection acting on them, but also potential problems with the methodological approach used to predict evolutionary responses of traits. Here, we used an 8-year data set on tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) to first assess the effects of differences among three nestling life-history stages on the genetic (co)variances of two morphological traits (body mass and primary feather length) and the selection acting on them over three generations. We then estimated the evolutionary potential of these traits by predicting their evolutionary responses using the breeder's equation and the secondary theorem of selection approaches. Our results showed variation in strength and direction of selection and slight changes in trait variance across ages. Predicted evolutionary responses differed importantly between both approaches for half of the trait–age combinations we studied, suggesting the presence of environmentally induced correlations between focal traits and fitness possibly biasing breeder's equation predictions. Our results emphasize that predictions of evolutionary potential for morphological traits are likely to be highly variable, both in strength and direction, depending on the life stage and method used, thus mitigating our capacity to predict adaptation and persistence of wild populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bourret","given":"A."},{"family":"Bélisle","given":"M."},{"family":"Pelletier","given":"F."},{"family":"Garant","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"bourretEvolutionaryPotentialMorphological2017","container-title":"Journal of Evolutionary Biology","DOI":"10.1111/jeb.13031","ISSN":"1420-9101","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"616-626","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evolutionary potential of morphological traits across different life-history stages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jeb.13031","volume":"30"},{"id":"bourtzisWolbachiaInfectionCytoplasmic1996","abstract":"Forty-one stocks from 30 Drosophila species were surveyed for Wolbachia infection usingPCR technology.

We used that fact to cull replicate calls from the same individual in field recordings of flocks observed at various locations throughout the sample area. Remaining recordings from a given year were submitted to spectrographic cross-correlation and principal coordinates analysis as described by Cortopassi and Bradbury (2000). Principal coordinates were then correlated with site location using MANOVA. Call durations were also examined for geographical patterns. Like sympatric Yellow-naped Parrots (Amazona auropalliata) studied over the same region by Wright (1996), Orange-fronted Parakeets exhibited significant geographic variation but, unlike the larger species, showed no discrete dialect patterns. Call duration varied clinally but with different patterns for the Nicoya Peninsula and the Guanacaste mainland. Two principal coordinates also showed clinal variation even after removing any correlated duration effects. Scale over which local calls were statistically homogeneous was 7-10 km. We compared that figure to home ranges of 18 birds radio-tracked concurrently with call sampling. Both range areas and range lengths were asymptotic after a week of tracking. Asymptotic range lengths were 2-9 km. Scale of movements of birds, at least during that period, was thus similar to distance within which calls tended to be statistically homogeneous.

As such, this gene will be a very useful tool for Wolbachia strain typing and phylogenetic analysis, as well as understanding the molecular basis of the interaction of Wolbachia with its host.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Braig","given":"Henk R."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Weiguo"},{"family":"Dobson","given":"Stephen L."},{"family":"O’Neill","given":"Scott L."}],"citation-key":"braigCloningCharacterizationGene1998","container-title":"Journal of Bacteriology","container-title-short":"J Bacteriol","ISSN":"0021-9193","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",5]]},"page":"2373-2378","PMCID":"PMC107178","PMID":"9573188","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Cloning and Characterization of a Gene Encoding the Major Surface Protein of the Bacterial Endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC107178/","volume":"180"},{"id":"brandMatingBehaviorReproductive2022","abstract":"Sex allocation is the distribution of resources to male or female reproduction. In hermaphrodites, this concerns an individual’s resource allocation to, for example, the production of male or female gametes. Macroevolutionary studies across hermaphroditic plants have revealed that the self-pollination rate and the pollination mode are strong predictors of sex allocation. Consequently, we expect similar factors such as the selfing rate and aspects of the reproductive biology, like the mating behaviour and the intensity of postcopulatory sexual selection, to predict sex allocation in hermaphroditic animals. However, comparative work on hermaphroditic animals is limited. Here, we study sex allocation in 120 species of the hermaphroditic free-living flatworm genus Macrostomum. We ask how hypodermic insemination, a convergently evolved mating behaviour where sperm are traumatically injected through the partner’s epidermis, affects the evolution of sex allocation. We also test the commonly-made assumption that investment into male and female reproduction should trade-off. Finally, we ask if morphological indicators of the intensity of postcopulatory sexual selection (female genital complexity, male copulatory organ length, and sperm length) can predict sex allocation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brand","given":"Jeremias N."},{"family":"Harmon","given":"Luke J."},{"family":"Schärer","given":"Lukas"}],"citation-key":"brandMatingBehaviorReproductive2022","container-title":"BMC Biology","container-title-short":"BMC Biology","DOI":"10.1186/s12915-022-01234-1","ISSN":"1741-7007","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,7]]},"page":"35","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Mating behavior and reproductive morphology predict macroevolution of sex allocation in hermaphroditic flatworms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-022-01234-1","volume":"20"},{"id":"brechtVolitionalControlVocalizations2019","abstract":"Songbirds are renowned for their acoustically elaborate songs.

Although the chapters are organised along conventional lines into sections on perceptual, cognitive and social development, the emphasis (appearing both within chapters and in the linking editorial passages within sections) is on links between perceptual, cognitive and social aspects of development. Thus, exciting new findings on infant perception are related to both old and new accounts of cognitive development, and links are drawn between these topics and the development of social interaction and language. There is a strong theoretical component in all sections of the book, with particular attention given to both traditional approaches such as Piagetian theory, and more recent approaches such as direct perception and dynamic systems theory. There is also a chapter devoted to interpreting infant development from a psychoanalytic perspective. A particular feature of this book is its aim to make recent findings and theoretical developments accessible to a student audience with little advanced knowledge of the area.

For instance, the states of anxiety and depression have been shown to be associated with “pessimistic” judgements of ambiguous stimuli intermediate between stimuli associated with positive and negative outcomes. This phenomenon provides a promising method for objectively assessing animal emotional states and has been successfully demonstrated in preliminary studies. However, the experiments yielding these results required extensive training to establish the necessary positive and negative associations. Here we present an experiment using responses to eyespot stimuli that are naturally aversive to many bird species, and require no explicit associative training. We manipulated the state of wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by playing one of four possible sounds: starling “threat call” (control manipulation), a sparrowhawk call (i.e. predator), starling alarm call or white noise, on the assumption that the latter three sounds would cause anxiety. Immediately following the auditory stimulus, we recorded the birds’ behaviour in the presence of each of three visual stimuli: eyespots, ambiguous eyespots or no eyespots. We hypothesised that there would be an interaction between the state of the birds and their response to eyespots, with birds showing enhanced aversion to ambiguous eyespots when anxious. We found evidence that white noise and alarm calls generated anxiety, and that eyespots were aversive. However, there was no interaction between state and response to eyespots. In an attempt to understand our failure to obtain the predicted cognitive bias, we discuss evidence that the aversive nature of eyespots is not attributable to predator mimicry, and is therefore not modulated by anxiety.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Brilot","given":"Ben O."},{"family":"Normandale","given":"Clare L."},{"family":"Parkin","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Bateson","given":"Melissa"}],"citation-key":"brilotCanWeUse2009","collection-title":"Special Issue: Animal Suffering and Welfare","container-title":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","container-title-short":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.applanim.2009.02.015","ISSN":"0168-1591","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"182-190","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Can we use starlings’ aversion to eyespots as the basis for a novel ‘cognitive bias’ task?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159109000458","volume":"118"},{"id":"brommerHIDDENREPRODUCTIVECONFLICT2008","abstract":"Environmental conditions experienced by a female prior to reproducing may be influenced by her mate.

There is strong selection for laying early in this population, and these sexually antagonistic genetic effects may contribute in maintaining the variation in laying date.

Data on 3986 individuals collected over a 34-year period indicate a dramatic senescent decline in late life. We also find that annual fitness is heritable and that individuals vary in their rates of ageing. However, counter to theoretical expectations, we find no support for a heritable component to the variance in rates of senescence. Increases in the among-individual (permanent environment) and residual variance components initiate an increase in the total phenotypic variance for annual fitness with age. This finding suggests that older birds are more sensitive to environmental effects, and that old age causes an overall pattern of declining h2 of annual fitness. Our findings suggest that individual-specific factors do have a role in determining the rate of senescence in this population, but that additive genetic variance for the rate of senescence is either absent or small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Brommer","given":"J.

The major pattern (ascending or descending) of notes in a song provided insufficient information for recognition, since strange songs were responded to as such, whether or not they resembled neighbors' songs in this respect. Songs consisting of only the first three notes permitted neighbor–stranger discrimination. Neighbors' songs were altered in various ways, though never beyond the normal range of variation for the population. We assumed that if features important for recognition of neighbors' songs were altered sufficiently, the birds would respond to neighbors' songs as though they were strange songs. We found that a change of more than 5 to 10% in pitch of the song, pitch of the first note, and possibly pitch change between the first and second notes interfered with recognition of a neighbor's song. In contrast, changes as great as 15% in duration of a song or of the first note had no effect on recognition. Reliance on pitch for recognition is consistent with present knowledge of natural variation in songs of individual white-throated sparrows and of auditory discrimination of birds.

There, grouping may allow them to overcome the defence of territorial breeders. Here, we focus on ravens making use of regular food supplies in a game park, where they divert food from the provision of park animals. We investigated if ravens foraging in the Cumberland game park (Grünau, Austria) are attentive towards one another when they experience some unpredictability in food provisioning. We confronted a group of 30–50 ravens with two different treatments. Ten minutes ahead of the feeding of either wolves or wild boars we showed buckets containing pieces of meat to the ravens flying overhead. In the reliable cue treatment (RCT), the meat was placed next to one of the two enclosures, whereas in the unreliable cue treatment (UCT), the buckets were placed simultaneously in front of both enclosures though only in one of the enclosures were the animals fed 10 min later. Thus, during RCT but not during UCT, ravens could predict where food would become available. Only during UCT, ravens moved in large groups between the two feeding sites. Many ravens moving at the same time in the same direction may indicate some co-ordination in space and time, which is most likely achieved by social attraction among individuals. Furthermore, the number of ravens approaching and leaving, respectively, a feeding site cross-correlated with a temporary increase in the rate of a food-associated call, the yell. This suggests that in addition to watching each other, calling may have contributed to group formation.

However, natural selection imposes demographic costs on a population, and if these costs are sufficiently large, the likelihood of extinction will be high. We consider how the mean time to extinction depends on selective pressures (rate and stochasticity of environmental change, and strength of selection), population parameters (carrying capacity, and reproductive capacity), and genetics (rate of polygenic mutation). We assume that in a randomly mating, finite population subject to density-dependent population growth, individual fitness is determined by a single quantitative-genetic character under Gaussian stabilizing selection with the optimum phenotype exhibiting directional change, or random fluctuations, or both. The quantitative trait is determined by a finite number of freely recombining, mutationally equivalent, additive loci. The dynamics of evolution and extinction are investigated, assuming that the population is initially under mutation-selection-drift balance. Under this model, in a directionally changing environment, the mean phenotype lags behind the optimum, but on the average evolves parallel to it. The magnitude of the lag determines the vulnerability to extinction. In finite populations, stochastic variation in the genetic variance can be quite pronounced, and bottlenecks in the genetic variance temporarily can impair the population's adaptive capacity enough to cause extinction when it would otherwise be unlikely in an effectively infinite population. We find that maximum sustainable rates of evolution or, equivalently, critical rates of environmental change, may be considerably less than 10% of a phenotypic standard deviation per generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bürger","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Lynch","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"burgerEvolutionExtinctionChanging1995","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb05967.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 1995 The Society for the Study of Evolution","page":"151-163","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evolution and Extinction in a Changing Environment: A Quantitative-Genetic Analysis","title-short":"Evolution and Extinction in a Changing Environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb05967.x","volume":"49"},{"id":"burgeringZebraFinchesTaeniopygia2019","abstract":"Humans can categorize vowels based on spectral quality (vowel identity) or pitch (speaker sex).

Many behavioral procedures have been proposed for modeling attention in animals, but not all of these procedures have been systematically associated with specific attentional processes. This review endeavors to evaluate critically the construct validity of these procedures (i.e., to determine the degree to which a given procedure assesses a particular process) and to suggest experiments to improve the conceptual links between these procedures and the processes they purport to assess. Five categories of processes have been identified from the animal literature: orienting, expectancy, stimulus differentiation (including stimulus salience, discrimination of a critical stimulus from its context, and selection among stimuli), sustained attention, and parallel processing. The review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of specific behavioral procedures for assessing these categories of attentional processes and, given the conceptual uncertainties involved, it attempts to summarize the present state of knowledge of the pharmacology and neurobiology of attention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bushnell","given":"Philip J."}],"citation-key":"bushnellBehavioralApproachesAssessment1998","container-title":"Psychopharmacology","container-title-short":"Psychopharmacology","DOI":"10.1007/s002130050668","ISSN":"1432-2072","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"231-259","source":"Springer Link","title":"Behavioral approaches to the assessment of attention in animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s002130050668","volume":"138"},{"id":"butlerEuropeanStarlingsRecognize2014","abstract":"Looking where others are allocating attention can facilitate social interactions by providing information about objects or locations of interest.

However, little is known about the way animals monitor conspecifics. We investigated the mechanism that European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, use to visually monitor group mates in perching situations through two questions. First, do starlings copy the timing of each other's vigilance? Second, do they use their centres of acute vision to monitor group mates? We studied a component of vigilance that has received relatively little attention, lateral scans, which consist of changes in the orientation of the head (i.e. gaze shifting) while in a head-up position. We found that starlings copied the timing of their neighbour's scans, placing them closer together in time than expected by chance. This could enhance the speed of social information spread within a group compared to random timing of head movements. The strength of this copying effect varied with neighbour distance and the sex of the follower and leader, suggesting that starlings appear to be more motivated to copy some individuals over others. Additionally, instead of monitoring neighbours with their centres of acute vision (high-quality vision), starlings tended to use their retinal periphery (low-acuity vision), potentially reducing the costs of social monitoring. Copying the timing of lateral scans may have advantages for gathering social information (i.e. quick responses to movements of group mates in situations such as murmurations). However, it can also have costs in terms of delaying the detection of personal information by any group member (e.g. predator attack) due to longer gaps without changes in gaze orientation. Therefore, copying the timing of lateral scans may be restricted to specific contexts (e.g. low predation risk).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Butler","given":"Shannon R."},{"family":"Hosinski","given":"Elizabeth C."},{"family":"Lucas","given":"Jeffrey R."},{"family":"Fernández-Juricic","given":"Esteban"}],"citation-key":"butlerSocialBirdsCopy2016","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.08.002","ISSN":"0003-3472","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"21-31","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social birds copy each other's lateral scans while monitoring group mates with low-acuity vision","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216301622","volume":"121"},{"id":"byrneBRUTEINTELLECT1991","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Byrne","given":"Richard W."}],"citation-key":"byrneBRUTEINTELLECT1991","container-title":"The Sciences","DOI":"10.1002/j.2326-1951.1991.tb02307.x","ISSN":"0036861X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991",5,6]]},"language":"en","page":"42-47","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"BRUTE INTELLECT","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/j.2326-1951.1991.tb02307.x","volume":"31"},{"id":"calderCategoricalPerceptionMorphed1996","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Calder","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Young","given":"Andrew W."},{"family":"Perrett","given":"David I."},{"family":"Etcoff","given":"Nancy L."},{"family":"Rowland","given":"Duncan"}],"citation-key":"calderCategoricalPerceptionMorphed1996","container-title":"Visual Cognition","container-title-short":"Visual Cognition","DOI":"10.1080/713756735","ISSN":"1350-6285, 1464-0716","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",6]]},"language":"en","page":"81-118","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Categorical Perception of Morphed Facial Expressions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713756735","volume":"3"},{"id":"camargoIRAMUTEQFreeSoftware2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Camargo","given":"Brigido Vizeu"},{"family":"Justo","given":"Ana Maria"}],"citation-key":"camargoIRAMUTEQFreeSoftware2013","container-title":"Temas em Psicologia","DOI":"10.9788/TP2013.2-16","ISSN":"1413-389X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12]]},"language":"en","page":"513-518","source":"pepsic.bvsalud.org","title":"IRAMUTEQ: a free software for analysis of textual data","title-short":"IRAMUTEQ","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pepsic.bvsalud.org/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S1413-389X2013000200016&lng=pt&nrm=iso&tlng=pt","volume":"21"},{"id":"camerlinkIndirectGeneticEffects2015","abstract":"Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of an individual on phenotypic values of others, and may result from social interactions.

High IGEg pigs showed from 8 to 23 weeks age 40 % less aggressive biting (P = 0.006), 27 % less ear biting (P = 0.03), and 40 % less biting on enrichment material (P = 0.005). High IGEg pigs had a lower tail damage score (high 2.0; low 2.2; P = 0.004), and consumed 30 % less jute sacks (P = 0.002). Selection on high IGEg reduced biting behaviours additive to the, generally much larger, effects of straw-bedding (P < 0.01), with no G × E interactions. These results show opportunities to reduce harmful biting behaviours in pigs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Camerlink","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Ursinus","given":"Winanda W."},{"family":"Bijma","given":"Piter"},{"family":"Kemp","given":"Bas"},{"family":"Bolhuis","given":"J.

One such body characteristic is the head/face orientation of the predator. However, a prey individual's ability to detect the head may be more difficult when the predator's body is serpentine, with little distinguishing the head from the tail. Here, we tested whether individuals in mixed-species flocks of Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) and tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) distinguish the head orientation of predator snake models. We conducted behavioral observations at multiple sites each having a bird feeder stocked with seed. Each chickadee and titmouse flock was exposed to two counterbalanced trials: a snake model with head closest to the seed area of the feeder and with tail closest to the seed area of the feeder. Observers recorded the number of seeds taken by each species and also the number of unsuccessful feeder visits. Chickadees and, to a lesser extent, titmice took fewer seeds and had more unsuccessful feeder visits when the head of the snake model was closest to the seed, compared to when the tail was closest to the seed. Titmice, furthermore, had more unsuccessful feeder visits to the black snake model type representing a real snake nest predator for these small songbirds. Therefore, head orientation seems an important factor that some species use to assess predation risk, even for predatory species where head orientation may be a subtle cue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cantwell","given":"Lisa R."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"W.

Physiological and behavioural adaptations in burrowing species, such as finding shelter in burrows when the summer conditions are unfavorable and hibernating in winter during the stressful period of resource shortage, could partly buffer the negative impacts of these forecasted changes. We studied the links between environmental factors and annual variations in adult mass and survival over 14 years in hoary marmots. We hypothesized that annual variation in seasonal environmental factors determines individual mass and survival through direct effects on food quality and availability, expecting greater survival when marmots reach higher mass before hibernation. We found that harsh winters decreased mass at emergence from hibernation by 47% compared with mild winters. Nonetheless, adult marmots had a greater mass gain in summers following harsh winters and reached a similar mass at the end of the summer compared with summers following mild winters. This suggests individuals can adopt a resource allocation strategy that allows maximizing summer mass gain to survive hibernation. Earlier springs also increased summer mass gain by 15 g day−1, and tended to increase apparent adult survival by 23%, compared with late springs. While these findings suggest a warming climate could have positive effects on summer mass gain and survival, survival also tended to decrease by 24% in summers with more precipitation. This suggests the forecasted changes in precipitation extremes could also trigger considerable negative effects on the demography of burrowing species in the long term. Our study shows that, although burrowing and hibernating behaviours could buffer responses to environmental changes, these behaviours are not an indefectible shield against climate change.","author":[{"family":"Carrier","given":"Béatrice"},{"family":"Hamel","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Garel","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Côté","given":"Steeve"}],"citation-key":"carrierCopingSeasonalityDynamics2022","container-title":"Oikos","container-title-short":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/oik.09043","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Coping with seasonality: dynamics of adult body mass and survival in an alpine hibernator","title-short":"Coping with seasonality","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},{"id":"carterAntiphonalCallingAllows2008","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Gerald G."},{"family":"Skowronski","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Faure","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Fenton","given":"Brock"}],"citation-key":"carterAntiphonalCallingAllows2008","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.04.023","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1343-1355","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Antiphonal calling allows individual discrimination in white-winged vampire bats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347208002960","volume":"76"},{"id":"carterSubtleCuesPredation2008","abstract":"For prey animals to negotiate successfully the fundamental trade-off between predation and starvation, a realistic assessment of predation risk is vital. Prey responses to conspicuous indicators of risk (such as looming predators or fleeing conspecifics) are well documented, but there should also be strong selection for the detection of more subtle cues. A predator's head orientation and eye-gaze direction are good candidates for subtle but useful indicators of risk, since many predators orient their head and eyes towards their prey as they attack. We describe the first explicit demonstration of a bird responding to a live predator's eye-gaze direction. We present wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) with human ‘predators’ whose frontal appearance and gaze direction are manipulated independently, and show that starlings are sensitive to the predator's orientation, the presence of eyes and the direction of eye-gaze. Starlings respond in a functionally significant manner: when the predator's gaze was averted, starlings resumed feeding earlier, at a higher rate and consumed more food overall. By correctly assessing lower risk and returning to feeding activity earlier (as in this study), the animal gains a competitive advantage over conspecifics that do not respond to the subtle predator cue in this way.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Lyons","given":"Nicholas J"},{"family":"Cole","given":"Hannah L"},{"family":"Goldsmith","given":"Arthur R"}],"citation-key":"carterSubtleCuesPredation2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2008.0095","issue":"1644","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,7]]},"page":"1709-1715","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Subtle cues of predation risk: starlings respond to a predator's direction of eye-gaze","title-short":"Subtle cues of predation risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.0095","volume":"275"},{"id":"castroAttentionalShiftsCategorization2016","abstract":"Once a categorization task has been mastered, if features that once were relevant become irrelevant and features that once were irrelevant become relevant, a decrement in performance—a shift cost—is typically observed. This shift cost may reﬂect the involvement of two distinguishable factors: the inability to release attention from a previously relevant feature (i.e., attentional perseveration) and/or the inability to re-engage attention to a previously irrelevant feature (i.e., learned irrelevance). Here, we examined the nature of this shift cost in pigeons. We gave four groups of pigeons a categorization task in which we monitored their choice accuracy; at the same time, we tracked the location of their pecks to the relevant and irrelevant attributes of the stimuli to determine to which attributes the birds were attending during the course of learning. After identical training in Phase 1, the roles of the relevant/irrelevant features were changed in Phase 2, so that one group could show only learned irrelevance, a second group could show only attentional perseverance, a third group could show both, and a fourth control group could show neither of these effects. Results disclosed evidence of attentional perseverance, but no evidence of learned irrelevance, either in accuracy or in relevant feature tracking. In addition, we determined that pigeons’ allocation of attention to the relevant features followed rather than preceded an increase in choice accuracy. Overall, our ﬁndings are best explained by theories which propose that attention is learned and deployed to those features that prove to be reliable predictors of the correct categorization response (e.g., George and Pearce, 2012; Kruschke, 2001; Mackintosh, 1975).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Castro","given":"Leyre"},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"castroAttentionalShiftsCategorization2016","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2015.11.001","ISSN":"03766357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2]]},"language":"en","page":"63-73","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Attentional shifts in categorization learning: Perseveration but not learned irrelevance","title-short":"Attentional shifts in categorization learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376635715300693","volume":"123"},{"id":"castroChapter29Perceptual","abstract":"Whether nonhuman animals—even those phylogenetically distant from humans, such as pigeons—can learn categories and to what extent the involved learning mechanisms are perceptually or conceptually based have been extensively researched over the past few decades.

The ﬂexibility of pigeons’ behavior was evidenced by their rapid, on-demand switching between tasks within training sessions. In addition, in Experiment 1, pigeons more accurately performed the numerosity task with arrays of different stimuli than with arrays of same stimuli and they more accurately performed the variability task with arrays of 16 stimuli than with arrays of 6 stimuli. In Experiment 2, when the magnitudes of the relevant and irrelevant dimensions were congruent, pigeons’ accuracy was higher than when the magnitudes were incongruent. Thus, the irrelevant dimension facilitated target discrimination performance when its magnitude matched the magnitude of the correct choice. These cross-task interactions suggest that a common computational mechanism underlies both discriminations.

We will show that pigeons are able to form both perceptual and abstract categories with considerable proficiency, and in much the same way as do humans and nonhuman primates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Castro","given":"Leyre"},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"castroPerceptualAbstractCategory2017b","container-title":"Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-08-101107-2.00029-4","ISBN":"978-0-08-101107-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"709-732","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perceptual and Abstract Category Learning in Pigeons","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780081011072000294"},{"id":"castroPigeonsTrackingRelevant2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Castro","given":"Leyre"},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"castroPigeonsTrackingRelevant2014","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition","DOI":"10.1037/xan0000022","ISSN":"2329-8464, 2329-8456","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"195-211","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pigeons’ tracking of relevant attributes in categorization learning.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xan0000022","volume":"40"},{"id":"castroSelectiveDistributedAttention2020","abstract":"Attention to relevant stimulus features in a categorization task helps to optimize performance.

Much less often considered is whether characters show differing amounts of genetic variance over the life-history of individuals. Such age-specific variation, if present, has important potential consequences for the force of natural selection and for understanding the causes of variation in quantitative characters. Using data from a long-term study of the mute swan Cygnus olor, we report the partitioning of phenotypic variance in timing of breeding (subject to strong natural selection) into component parts over 12 different age classes. We show that the additive genetic variance and heritability of this trait are strongly age-dependent, with higher additive genetic variance present in young and, particularly, old birds, but little evidence of any genetic variance for birds of intermediate ages. These results demonstrate that age can have a very important influence on the components of variation of characters in natural populations, and consequently that separate age classes cannot be assumed to be equivalent, either with respect to their evolutionary potential or response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Charmantier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Perrins","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"McCleery","given":"Robin H"},{"family":"Sheldon","given":"Ben C"}],"citation-key":"charmantierAgedependentGeneticVariance2005","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2005.3294","issue":"1583","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11]]},"page":"225-232","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Age-dependent genetic variance in a life-history trait in the mute swan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2005.3294","volume":"273"},{"id":"charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014","abstract":"There are multiple observations around the globe showing that in many avian species, both the timing of migration and breeding have advanced, due to warmer springs.

Within the abundant literature on climate change effects on bird phenology, only a small fraction of studies are based on individual data, yet individual data are required to quantify the relative importance of plastic versus evolutionary responses. While plasticity seems common and often adaptive, no study so far has provided direct evidence for an evolutionary response of bird phenology to current climate change. This assessment leads us to notice the alarming lack of tests for microevolutionary changes in bird phenology in response to climate change, in contrast with the abundant claims on this issue.

However, these studies mostly base their pedigree relationships on social information, despite the known widespread genetic polygamy in avian species. Here, we study the influence of misassigned paternities, combined with the effect of pedigree size and depth, on the estimation of heritability. First, we compute simulations of a polygenic trait for two levels of heritability (0.1 and 0.4), several extra-pair paternity rates (ranging from 5% to 40%), and varying sample sizes (20, 50 and 100 broods) or pedigree depth (2 or 4 generations). We compare heritability estimates from the social and the genetic pedigree, running a restricted maximum-likelihood ‘animal model’. Social pedigree underestimates heritability by an average of 0–17% for 5–20% extra-pair paternities and by up to 18% for 40% extra-pair paternities and a heritability of 0.4. Second, we identifyied extra-pair offspring using microsatellite loci in two populations of blue tits (Parus caeruleus) showing high levels of extra-pair paternities (15% and 25% of extra-pair offspring). We compare heritabilities of tarsus length and body mass estimated with pedigrees of increasing accuracy. These analyses suggest that the bias induced by misassigned paternities on heritability estimation depends on the level of heritability and the rate of paternity error. Typical rates of extra-pair paternities in birds (around 20% of offspring) should result in an underestimation of heritability of less than 15% when estimated over a minimum of 100 broods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Charmantier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Réale","given":"Denis"}],"citation-key":"charmantierHowMisassignedPaternities2005","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","container-title-short":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02619.x","ISSN":"0962-1083, 1365-294X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",8]]},"language":"en","page":"2839-2850","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How do misassigned paternities affect the estimation of heritability in the wild?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02619.x","volume":"14"},{"id":"charnovSimultaneousHermaphroditismSexual1979","abstract":"Theory about the evolution of sexual behavior in dioecious species is based on the general assumption that egg production is limited by a female's ability to garner resources to make eggs, not by a lack of sperm to fertilize them.

Here, we leverage a 38-year dataset following the fates of 53,959 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) to investigate whether a free-ranging vertebrate species can morphologically adapt to long-term environmental change sufficiently to promote population persistence. Despite strong selective pressures, we found that penguins did not adapt morphologically to long-term environmental changes, leading to projected population extirpation. Fluctuating selection benefited larger penguins in some environmental contexts, and smaller penguins in others, ultimately mitigating their ability to adapt under increasing environmental variability. Under future climate projections, we found that the species cannot be rescued by adaptation, suggesting similar constraints for other long-lived species. Such results reveal how fluctuating selection driven by environmental variability can inhibit adaptation under long-term environmental change.

If maternal genetic effects exist but are neglected, direct heritability is overestimated, and sometimes more than double. The bias depends on the value of the genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects. To study the influence of data structure on the estimation of genetic parameters, several populations were simulated, with different degrees of known paternity and different levels of genetic connectedness between flocks. Results showed that the lack of connectedness affects estimates when flocks have different genetic means because no distinction can be made between genetic and environmental differences between flocks. In this case, direct and maternal heritabilities are under-estimated, whereas maternal environmental effects are overestimated. The insufficiency of pedigree leads to biased estimates of genetic parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Clément","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Bibé","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Verrier","given":"Étienne"},{"family":"Elsen","given":"Jean-Michel"},{"family":"Manfredi","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Bouix","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Hanocq","given":"Éric"}],"citation-key":"clementSimulationAnalysisTest2001","container-title":"Genetics Selection Evolution","container-title-short":"Genet Sel Evol","DOI":"10.1186/1297-9686-33-4-369","ISSN":"1297-9686","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",7,15]]},"language":"en","page":"369","source":"Springer Link","title":"Simulation analysis to test the influence of model adequacy and data structure on the estimation of genetic parameters for traits with direct and maternal effects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-33-4-369","volume":"33"},{"id":"clementsIndicatorsTransitionsBiological2018","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              In the face of global biodiversity declines, predicting the fate of biological systems is a key goal in ecology. One popular approach is the search for early warning signals (\n              EWS\n              s) based on alternative stable states theory.

In socially monogamous species, females may seek extra-pair copulation to gain genetic benefits. In order to test this 'genetic quality' hypothesis, one must compare the performance of extra-pair young (EPY) and within-pair young (WPY). Such tests, however, are scarce and results published so far are inconclusive. 2. Here, we test the 'genetic quality' hypothesis using multistate capture-recapture models to compare age-specific survival and access to dominance between EPY and WPY in the alpine marmot Marmota marmota, a socially monogamous mammal showing extra-pair paternities. 3. When compared with WPY, survival of EPY was higher by 15%, 10% and 30%, for juveniles, yearlings and 2-year-old individuals, respectively. Survival at older ages did not differ. 4. Survival corresponded to true survival for yearlings and juveniles as dispersal does not occur before 2 years of age in marmots. For older individuals, survival estimates included a mixture of survival and dispersal. The 30% increase of the 2-year-old EPY survival might reflect delayed dispersal rather than high survival of EPY as compared with WPY. 5. WPY and EPY had the same probability (0.28) to access dominance at 2 years of age, but EPY were more successful at older ages than WPY (0.46 vs. 0.10). 6. Both survival and reproductive performance were higher in EPY than in WPY. The fitness advantages of adopting such a mixed mating tactic are thus likely to be high for marmot females. We suggest that obtaining genetic benefits is the main evolutionary force driving extra-pair paternity in alpine marmots.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Bonenfant","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Jean-Michel"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"cohasAreExtraPairYoung2007","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","ISSN":"0021-8790","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"771-781","publisher":"[Wiley, British Ecological Society]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Are Extra-Pair Young Better than Within-Pair Young?

Five birds and 8 humans learned six-dimensional perceptual categories constructed to include prototypes, typical items, and exceptions. We evaluated the birds' and humans' categorization strategies at different points during learning. Early on in both species, prototype performance improved rapidly as exception performance remained below chance, indicating an initial mastery of the categories' general structure. Later on, exception performance improved selectively and dramatically, indicating exception-item resolution and exemplar memorization. Abstraction- and exemplar-based formal models reinforced these interpretations.

In each experiment, the consistent group was tested such that the same and different displays of four display types were consistently mapped onto their choice alternatives. The inconsistent group received a conflicting mapping of the same and different displays and the choice alternatives that differed across the four display types but were consistent within a display type. Experiment 1 tested experienced pigeons, and Experiment 2 tested naive pigeons. In both experiments, the consistent group learned their discrimination faster and to a higher level of choice accuracy than did the inconsistent group, which performed poorly in general. Only in the consistent group was the discrimination transferred to novel stimuli, indicative of concept formation in that group. A third experiment documented that the different display classes were discriminable from one another.

Are local ecological communities ever saturated with species? That is, do they ever reach a point where species from the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because of exclusion by resident species? 2. We review the theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation. 3. Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions. 4. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time. 5. We then argue that unsaturated (Type I) assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales. 6. If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local richness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. 7. Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction of control for species richness is from regional to local. If correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Cornell","given":"H.

We do this using synthetic sounds modeled after the individually-distinctive, harmonically-rich contact calls of wild orange-fronted conures Aratinga canicularis. Calls with acoustic properties similar to Aratinga contact calls are common in other taxa including nonoscine birds, primates and cetaceans. We generated signals with known variations in time-frequency pattern, duration, noise level, harmonic content and harmonic weighting, and applied SPCC-PCO analysis to obtain an ordering of sounds in n-dimensional space. We find that shared time-frequency patterns dominate the positioning of sounds in PCO space. This was true despite high variability in signal-to-noise ratio (from -60 to +40 dB) and duration (150-275 ms). Furthermore, inclusion of naturallyweighted harmonics (versus fundamentals only) enhances, rather than obscures, the separation of call types. We conclude that SPCC-PCO is an effective method for sorting sounds based on overall time-frequency pattern. In addition, the resulting PCO measures can be used in statistical tests of association with extrinsic variables. The method is thus an effective starting point for examining most bioacoustic hypotheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Cortopassi","given":"Kathryn A."},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Jack W."}],"citation-key":"cortopassiCOMPARISONHARMONICALLYRICH2000","container-title":"Bioacoustics","container-title-short":"Bioacoustics","DOI":"10.1080/09524622.2000.9753454","ISSN":"0952-4622, 2165-0586","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1]]},"language":"en","page":"89-127","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"THE COMPARISON OF HARMONICALLY RICH SOUNDS USING SPECTROGRAPHIC CROSS-CORRELATION AND PRINCIPAL COORDINATES ANALYSIS","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09524622.2000.9753454","volume":"11"},{"id":"cortopassiContactCallDiversity2006","abstract":"Contact calls are used to maintain cohesion and coordinate movements in social animals. The amount and type of identity information provided by contact calls are linked to social organization. Socially stable species often converge on shared group-specific contact calls. In socially fluid species, contact calls tend to be individually distinctive; evidence indicates that such calls are important for mediating individual-specific interactions. Dolphins, for example, will mimic the individually distinctive contact calls of other individuals while socializing. We examined contact calls in another fission–fusion species, the orange-fronted parakeet. Free-living and temporarily captive nonbreeding pairs as well as free-living breeding pairs were recorded. In all contexts, pairs produced multiple (up to nine) discrete contact call types, but like dolphins, typically favoured one to two individually specific variants per bird. The number of dominant variants produced and their evenness of use varied with context. Captive pairs produced the fewest dominants, using them with high evenness. Free-living nonbreeding pairs produced more dominants, and showed similarly high evenness. Breeding pairs varied widely in the number of dominants produced and their evenness of use, showing both the highest and lowest values of each. Latent acoustic measures revealed greater structural variation within and among dominants for free-living compared to captive pairs, presumably reflecting the increased opportunity for social interaction available in the wild. Across contexts, calls could be accurately assigned to pair using acoustic measures; however, within-pair call clustering was not greater than that between pairs. Pairs' calls were distinctive, but in a way that preserved individual variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Cortopassi","given":"Kathryn A."},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Jack W."}],"citation-key":"cortopassiContactCallDiversity2006","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.09.011","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1141-1154","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Contact call diversity in wild orange-fronted parakeet pairs, Aratinga canicularis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347206000303","volume":"71"},{"id":"coulonAssessingVideoPresentations2014","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of video presentations of natural landscapes on European starlings' (Sturnus vulgaris) stereotypic behaviours (SBs) and other abnormal repetitive behaviours (ARBs) and to evaluate the impact of past experience by comparing wild-caught and hand-reared starlings' reactions. Ten wild-caught and five hand-reared starlings were presented 1-hour videos of landscapes twice a day for five successive days, while a control group of eight wild-caught and four hand-reared starlings was presented a grey screen for the same amount of time. The analysis of the starlings' behaviour revealed that the video presentations of landscapes appeared to have a positive but limited and experience-dependent effect on starlings' SBs and other ARBs compared to the controls. Indeed, whereas video presentations seemed to modulate high rates of SBs and ARBs, they did not appear to be enriching enough to prevent the emergence or the development of SBs and ARBs in an impoverished environment. They even appeared to promote a particular type of SB (somersaulting) that is thought to be linked to escape motivation. The fact that this effect was observed in hand-reared starlings suggests that videos of landscapes could elicit motivation to escape even in birds that never experienced outdoor life. These results highlight the importance of investigating stereotypic behaviour both quantitatively and qualitatively in order to provide crucial clues on animal welfare.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Coulon","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Henry","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Perret","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"},{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"coulonAssessingVideoPresentations2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0096949","editor":[{"family":"Chapouthier","given":"Georges"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5]]},"language":"en","page":"e96949","title":"Assessing Video Presentations as Environmental Enrichment for Laboratory Birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096949","volume":"9"},{"id":"coulonInfanticideAlpineMarmot1995","abstract":"We report the first case of directly observed infanticide in the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota).

In all cases, infanticidal animals were adult males entering a territory in the absence of the resident or having taken over the territory. As in the Arctic ground squirrel, Spermophilus parryii, infanticide could have evolved in Alpine marmots as a part of the reproductive strategy of new resident males. According to ARNOLD (1990), young increase the energetic cost for related animals hibernating with them. Thus, while a rapid return to oestrus is not a realistic outcome, because it occurs only in early spring, infanticide could reduce hibernation costs for the female and increase her reproductive potential in the following year. A sexual selection hypothesis would explain infanticide in Alpine marmot.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Coulon","given":"J."},{"family":"Graziani","given":"L."},{"family":"Allainé","given":"D."},{"family":"Bel","given":"M.C."},{"family":"Pouderoux","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"coulonInfanticideAlpineMarmot1995","container-title":"Ethology Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1080/08927014.1995.9522965","ISSN":"0394-9370","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",4,1]]},"page":"191–194","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Infanticide in the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08927014.1995.9522965","volume":"7"},{"id":"cousillasLateralizationSocialSignal2020","abstract":"Group cohesion relies on the ability of its members to process social signals.

Communication requires adaptability throughout the life of an individual, especially in species for which breeding periods (when intersexual signaling prevails) are interspersed with more ‘social’ (non-sexual) periods when intrasexual bonding prevails. In songbirds, structure or frequency of songs or song elements may convey different information depending on the season. This is the case in the European starling, where some song structures characterize social bonds between females while other song structures are more characteristic of male courtship. We hypothesized that the female perceptual system may have adapted to these changes in song structure and function according to season, and we tested for potential seasonal brain plasticity. Electrophysiological recordings from adult female starlings during playback of song elements with different functions showed clear seasonal (breeding/non-breeding) changes in neuronal responses in the primary auditory area. The proportion of responsive sites was higher in response to social (non-sexual) songs during the non-reproductive season, and higher in response to sexual songs during the reproductive season.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Alcaix","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Henry","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"}],"citation-key":"cousillasSeasonalFemaleBrain2013","container-title":"European Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Eur J Neurosci","DOI":"10.1111/ejn.12089","ISSN":"0953816X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3]]},"language":"en","page":"728-734","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Seasonal female brain plasticity in processing social vs. sexual vocal signals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/ejn.12089","volume":"37"},{"id":"cousillasSocialExperienceInfluences2006","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Mathelier","given":"Maryvonne"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Henry","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"}],"citation-key":"cousillasSocialExperienceInfluences2006","container-title":"Naturwissenschaften","container-title-short":"Naturwissenschaften","DOI":"10.1007/s00114-006-0148-4","ISSN":"0028-1042, 1432-1904","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11,22]]},"language":"en","page":"588-596","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social experience influences the development of a central auditory area","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00114-006-0148-4","volume":"93"},{"id":"craigBEHAVIOURPALEWINGEDSTARLINGS1991","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Craig","given":"A.

We analysed whether wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, of four communities living in a similar habitat in the Taı¨ Forest, Coˆ te d’Ivoire, developed community speciﬁc pant hoots. If so, we expected males of three contiguous communities to have distinct pant hoots, while pant hoots of males from a fourth, distant community, located 70 km away, should only diﬀer from those of the contiguous communities by chance. Our analysis conﬁrmed these expectations. In addition, the acoustic distances between the pant hoots of pairs of individuals did not correlate with the genetic relatedness of those pairs, where genetic relatedness was determined using nuclear DNA analysis. Thus, neither habitat nor genetic diﬀerences accounted for the observation that there were acoustic diﬀerences in the pant hoot structure of males living in neighbouring communities, but not in those of males from a distant community. This suggests that chimpanzees may actively modify pant hoots to be diﬀerent from their neighbours, providing support for the vocal learning hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Crockford","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Herbinger","given":"Ilka"},{"family":"Vigilant","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Boesch","given":"Christophe"}],"citation-key":"crockfordWildChimpanzeesProduce2004","container-title":"Ethology","container-title-short":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1439-0310.2004.00968.x","ISSN":"0179-1613, 1439-0310","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",3]]},"language":"en","page":"221-243","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Wild Chimpanzees Produce Group-Specific Calls: a Case for Vocal Learning?","title-short":"Wild Chimpanzees Produce Group-Specific Calls","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2004.00968.x","volume":"110"},{"id":"cuiThermalInkjetPrinting2012","abstract":"With the advantages of high throughput, digital control, and highly accurate placement of cells and biomaterial scaffold to the desired 2D and 3D locations, bioprinting has great potential to develop promising approaches in translational medicine and organ replacement.

In the present study we explore the effect of communal rearing conditions (3 dams with 3 litters per cage) during the postnatal period on offspring (F1) and grand-offspring (F2) anxiety-like and maternal behavior in Balb/c mice. Females rearing pups in communal nests exhibited increased levels of postpartum maternal care and communal rearing was found to abolish sex-differences in weaning weights. In adulthood, communally reared offspring were observed to display reduced anxiety-like behavior when placed in a novel environment. When rearing their own offspring under standard conditions, communally reared females demonstrated higher levels of motivation to retrieve pups, built higher quality nests, and exhibited higher levels of postpartum care compared to standard reared females. When exposed to an intruder male, communally reared females were more subordinate and less aggressive. F2 offspring of communally reared females were observed to engage in reduced anxiety-like behavior, have larger litter sizes and an increased frequency of nursing on day PND 1. Analysis of neuropeptide receptor levels suggest that a communal rearing environment may exert sustained effects on behavior through modification of oxytocin and vasopressin (V1a) receptor densities.

Such signals may vary in a number of features such as the rules that govern note order and timing (syntax), the relative number and types of different notes (note composition), and the acoustic structure of notes (phonology). Previous research examining male song in songbirds typically has shown greater conservation of syntax than phonology. Here we investigated whether these patterns of variation are also found in the duets of parrots. We examined geographic variation in the pair duets of yellow-naped amazons, Amazona auropalliata, at ﬁve sites within one vocal dialect. We also examined variation at several levels of social organization, including within pairs, among pairs and among sites, to assess where variability was greatest. Variation was highest at the within-pair level, although variation was also present at all other levels and for all of the duet factors. We hypothesize that variation at the among-site level allows duets to indicate site membership, while variation at the within-pair level allows pairs to change their duet to match their current social or physical environment. Syntax and phonology are also more conserved than note composition for all levels of social organization. This pattern may result because note composition is less important in duet function than syntax or phonology, or because development of syntax and phonology is more heavily inﬂuenced by genetic templates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Dahlin","given":"Christine R."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Timothy F."}],"citation-key":"dahlinDuetsYellowNapedAmazons2009","container-title":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01669.x","ISSN":"01791613, 14390310","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9]]},"language":"en","page":"857-871","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Duets in Yellow-Naped Amazons: Variation in Syntax, Note Composition and Phonology at Different Levels of Social Organization","title-short":"Duets in Yellow-Naped Amazons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01669.x","volume":"115"},{"id":"dahlinPairDuetsYellownaped2007","abstract":"Pair duets are acoustically complex communication signals formed jointly by members of a mated pair.

Duets were composed of contact calls and three other note types found only in duets. These latter note types were sex-speciﬁc, with one type performed by females and the other two types by males. Sex-speciﬁc notes were delivered antiphonally and in distinct pairs, with the male note following and often overlapping that of the female. Note types appeared in a strict sequential order in which each note could be repeated a variable number of times or omitted entirely, a pattern previously termed ‘combinatorial syntax’. Additionally, there was considerable variation in acoustic parameters of notes within types. Many of these parameters varied signiﬁcantly with note order within a duet.

The domestic chick possesses a lateralized visual system. This has effects on the chick's perception towards and interaction with its environment. This includes its ability to live successfully within a social group. We show that there is a tendency for right brain hemisphere dominance when performing social cognitive actions. As such, chicks show a left hemispatial bias for approaching a signalled target object, tend to perceive gaze and faces of human-like masks more effectively when using their left eye, are able to inhibit a pecking response more effectively when viewing a neighbour tasting a bitter substance with their left eye, and are better able to perform a transitive inference task when exposed to light in the egg and when forced to use their left eye only compared to dark-hatched or right eye chicks. Some of these effects were sex specific, with male chicks tending to show an increased effect of lateralization on their behaviours. These data are discussed in terms of overall social cognition in group living.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Daisley","given":"Jonathan Niall"},{"family":"Mascalzoni","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Rosa-Salva","given":"Orsola"},{"family":"Rugani","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Regolin","given":"Lucia"}],"citation-key":"daisleyLateralizationSocialCognition2009","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2008.0229","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1519","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,12]]},"page":"965-981","PMCID":"PMC2666078","PMID":"19064355","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Lateralization of social cognition in the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2666078/","volume":"364"},{"id":"daisleyLogicAsymmetricalSocial2010","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Daisley","given":"Jonathan Niall"},{"family":"Vallortigara","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Regolin","given":"Lucia"}],"citation-key":"daisleyLogicAsymmetricalSocial2010","container-title":"Social Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Social Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1080/17470910903529795","ISSN":"1747-0919, 1747-0927","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,2]]},"language":"en","page":"309-319","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Logic in an asymmetrical (social) brain: Transitive inference in the young domestic chick","title-short":"Logic in an asymmetrical (social) brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470910903529795","volume":"5"},{"id":"daleSignalingIndividualIdentity","abstract":"We develop an evolutionary model that predicts that characters selected to signal individual identity will have properties differing from those expected for indicator signals of quality.

The flight call is equivalent to the functional song and contains the species-specific recognition code. Flight calls may also be uttered when perched and, when in quick series, function as long-range alarm calls. Long-range alarm calls become a high intensity congregation signal when several individuals overlap and, despite degradation and attenuation, may contain the species-specific code over distances of 800 m. The average (6SD) feeding flock size was 7.7 6 8.2 individuals (n 5 116) while the roosting flock size was 79.1 6 10.5 individuals (n 5 7). Short-range calls maintain communication while minimizing detection. High intensity vocalizations allow long-range communication, improving feeding efficiency through use of large areas and stimulating late afternoon roost congregations.

We thus decided to use in vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine auditory responses of male starlings that were exposed to songs that convey different levels of information (species-speciﬁc and group identity or individual identity), both during (when mate recognition is particularly important) and outside the breeding season (when group recognition is particularly important).

If these vocal characteristics are to be utilised as non-invasive markers for monitoring purposes, then they must remain stable over time. Three recent studies have shown that it is possible to identify individual male Common Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) based on vocal characteristics, but whether these characteristics are stable over the duration of a breeding season remains unknown. We recorded 1032 syllables from 30 male Common Cuckoos in a Northeast Asian population. We banded six of these males and made repeated recordings of their cu-coo advertisement call across a 19-day period of the breeding season in China. We used three methods to identify individuals: discriminant function analyses (DFA), correlation analysis (CA) and spectrographic cross-correlation (SPCC). We also used repeatability analysis to test whether call consistency (the number of syllables in each calling bout) was repeatable within individuals. Based on the same-day recordings, calls from the same male were more similar in their characteristics than compared to those of different males, and yielded correct rates of classifying individuals of 93.6% (SPCC), 90.8% (DFA), and 71.5% (CA). However, these rates declined to 40.5% (SPCC), 40.7% (DFA) and 27% (CA) when using recordings over the 19-day period. Call consistency was repeatable within individuals across two successive calling bouts, but this individual repeatability disappeared when several (more than two) calling bouts from the same day or bouts from the different days of the study were included in the analyses. Declines in the correct rate of identifying individual male cuckoos and call consistency in this study raise concerns that individual male cuckoo calls may be more variable than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Deng","given":"Zhuqing"},{"family":"Lloyd","given":"Huw"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Canwei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Donglai"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yanyun"}],"citation-key":"dengSeasonDeclineCall2019","container-title":"Journal of Ornithology","container-title-short":"J Ornithol","DOI":"10.1007/s10336-019-01631-4","ISSN":"2193-7192, 2193-7206","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"language":"en","page":"317-327","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Within-season decline in call consistency of individual male Common Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10336-019-01631-4","volume":"160"},{"id":"dentFrequencyDiscriminationBudgerigars2000","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dent","given":"Micheal L."},{"family":"Dooling","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Pierce","given":"Alisa S."}],"citation-key":"dentFrequencyDiscriminationBudgerigars2000","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","container-title-short":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.428651","ISSN":"0001-4966","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",5]]},"language":"en","page":"2657-2664","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Frequency discrimination in budgerigars ( <i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i> ): Effects of tone duration and tonal context","title-short":"Frequency discrimination in budgerigars ( <i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i> )","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.428651","volume":"107"},{"id":"dentressangleMalesUseTime2012","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Dentressangle","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Aubin","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Mathevon","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"dentressangleMalesUseTime2012","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.012","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8]]},"language":"en","page":"413-420","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Males use time whereas females prefer harmony: individual call recognition in the dimorphic blue-footed booby","title-short":"Males use time whereas females prefer harmony","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347212002321","volume":"84"},{"id":"devereuxHabitatAffectsEscape2008","abstract":"Animals should adapt their escape behaviour to both physical and social surroundings in order to maximize their probability of survival. Cover can be both obstructive, reducing the visibility of the surroundings and hindering escape, and protective, providing refuge. We investigated how the provision of cover (long grass) affected (1) the escape behaviour and (2) the alarm call behaviour of Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris responding to a model hawk during a simulated attack. Starlings always retreated away from the predator and sometimes alarm-called. Their escape trajectory was close to the ground when escaping in long grass, which could be explained by either tall swards hindering take-off or such swards being used as protective cover. On short grass their escape trajectory was much steeper (> 45°). We also investigated the use of alarm calls in Starlings according to predictions arising from the costs and benefits to callers and receivers. Callers could benefit from using alarm calls through dilution or confusion if their use initiates flock departures, thus reducing their probability of being targeted. If there is no cost to the producer of alarm calls we predicted that detectors should call at all times to gain these benefits (i.e. irrespective of grass length), but if their use is costly we predicted that they would be used only when the benefits outstrip the costs. In this case we would predict that alarm calls would be given when other (visual) signals were impaired on long grass but not when they were effective on short grass. Starlings used alarm calls on long grass when visibility was reduced more frequently than on short grass, suggesting that calling has a cost to the producer. The contrasting escape strategies of Starlings in relation to a relatively small (10 cm) change in grass height demonstrates the potential importance of habitat structure in determining predation risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Devereux","given":"Claire L."},{"family":"Fernàndez‐Juricic","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Krebs","given":"John R."},{"family":"Whittingham","given":"Mark J."}],"citation-key":"devereuxHabitatAffectsEscape2008","container-title":"Ibis","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00835.x","ISSN":"1474-919X","issue":"s1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2008 The Authors.

An individual's perception of predation risk may depend on many factors, such as distance to refuge and group size, but it is unclear whether individuals respond to different factors in a similar manner. We tested whether flocks of foraging starlings responded in the same way to an increased perception of predation risk by assessing three factors: (1) neighbor distances, (2) habitat obstruction, and (3) recent exposure to a predator. We found that in all three scenarios of increased risk, starlings reduced their interscan intervals (food-searching bouts), which increased the frequency of their vigilance periods. We then examined how one of these factors, habitat obstruction, affected escape speed by simulating an attack with a model predator. Starlings were slower to respond in visually obstructed habitats (long grass swards) and slower when they had their head down in obstructed habitats than when they had their head down in open habitats. In addition, reaction times were quicker when starlings could employ their peripheral fields of vision. Our results demonstrate that different sources of increased risk can generate similar behavioral responses within a species. The degree of visibility in the physical and social environment affects both the actual and perceived risk of predation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Devereux","given":"Claire L."},{"family":"Whittingham","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Fernández-Juricic","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Vickery","given":"Juliet A."},{"family":"Krebs","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"devereuxPredatorDetectionAvoidance2006","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arj032","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3,1]]},"page":"303-309","source":"Silverchair","title":"Predator detection and avoidance by starlings under differing scenarios of predation risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arj032","volume":"17"},{"id":"devillemereuilFixedeffectVarianceEstimation2018","abstract":"Linear mixed-effects models are frequently used for estimating quantitative genetic parameters, including the heritability, as well as the repeatability, of traits. Heritability acts as a ﬁlter that determines how efﬁciently phenotypic selection translates into evolutionary change, whereas repeatability informs us about the individual consistency of phenotypic traits. As quantities of biological interest, it is important that the denominator, the phenotypic variance in both cases, reﬂects the amount of phenotypic variance in the relevant ecological setting. The current practice of quantifying heritabilities and repeatabilities from mixed-effects models frequently deprives their denominator of variance explained by ﬁxed effects (often leading to upward bias of heritabilities and repeatabilities), and it has been suggested to omit ﬁxed effects when estimating heritabilities in particular. We advocate an alternative option of ﬁtting models incorporating all relevant effects, while including the variance explained by ﬁxed effects into the estimation of the phenotypic variance. The approach is easily implemented and allows optimizing the estimation of phenotypic variance, for example by the exclusion of variance arising from experimental design effects while still including all biologically relevant sources of variation. We address the estimation and interpretation of heritabilities in situations in which potential covariates are themselves heritable traits of the organism. Furthermore, we discuss complications that arise in generalized and nonlinear mixed models with ﬁxed effects. In these cases, the variance parameters on the data scale depend on the location of the intercept and hence on the scaling of the ﬁxed effects. Integration over the biologically relevant range of ﬁxed effects offers a preferred solution in those situations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"De Villemereuil","given":"P."},{"family":"Morrissey","given":"M.

The function of lateralization is a question under investigation now. In a previous study, it was shown that chicks incubated in the dark (Da), which prevents the development of lateralization of visual foraging and predator detection, did not perform well when two tasks requiring simultaneous use of the expertise of the right and left eye systems were presented. Performance of a task requiring the chick to find grains against a background of pebbles deteriorated in the Da chicks in the presence of a predator. In the study reported here, the two simultaneous tasks were tested in both binocular and monocular conditions to establish the role of each eye system. Learning of the pebble-floor task was poor in Da chicks tested binocularly or monocularly and in the light-exposed (Li) chicks using the left eye (LE). The time taken to complete the pebble-floor task in the presence of a predator was significantly longer for the Da chicks. This was because pecking was interrupted for longer times when the predator was presented, and the Da chicks made more distress calls than the Li. The latency to detect the predator was longest in the Li chicks using the right eye (RE) (i.e., the Li were lateralized). In the Li chicks, sustained initial viewing of the predator was by the LE. There was no LE/RE difference in the Da chicks. The intensity of responses decreased with continued presentation of the predator but forced use of the RE slowed this habituation. Exposure to light before hatching affects lateralization of both learning of the pebble-floor task and the detection of an overhead predator. Attending to the foraging and predator vigilance tasks simultaneously is impaired in the Da chicks and the superior ability of Li (lateralized) chicks is due to a specific effect of light stimulation of the RE prior to hatching. We have shown that superior performance on the dual task results from the ability to allocate food searching to one hemisphere (left) and predator vigilance to the other (right) hemisphere, achieved only by Li chicks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Dharmaretnam","given":"M."},{"family":"Rogers","given":"L.

Yet, growth is commonly observed to occur at rates lower than the maximum that is physiologically possible and intrinsic growth rates often vary among populations. This implies that slower growth is favoured under certain conditions. Realized growth rate is thus the result of a compromise between the costs and advantages of growing rapidly, and the optimal rate of growth is not equivalent to the fundamental maximum rate. The ecological and evolutionary factors influencing growth rate are reviewed, with particular emphasis on how growth might be constrained by direct fitness costs. Costs of accelerating growth might contribute to the variance in fitness that is not attributable to age or size at maturity, as well as to the variation in life-history strategies observed within and among species. Two main approaches have been taken to study the fitness trade-offs relating to growth rate. First, environmental manipulations can be used to produce treatment groups with different rates of growth. Second, common garden experiments can be used to compare fitness correlates among populations with different intrinsic growth rates. Data from these studies reveal a number of potential costs for growth over both the short and long term. In order to acquire the energy needed for faster growth, animals must increase food intake. Accordingly, in many taxa, the major constraint on growth rate appears to arise from the trade-off between predation risk and foraging effort. However, growth rates are also frequently observed to be submaximal in the absence of predation, suggesting that growth trajectories also impact fitness via other channels, such as the reallocation of finite resources between growth and other traits and functions. Despite the prevalence of submaximal growth, even when predators are absent, there is surprisingly little evidence to date demonstrating predator-independent costs of growth acceleration. Evidence that does exist indicates that such costs may be most apparent under stressful conditions. Future studies should examine more closely the link between patterns of resource allocation to traits in the adult organism and lifetime fitness. Changes in body composition at maturation, for example, may determine the outcome of trade-offs between reproduction and survival or between early and late reproduction. A number of design issues for studies investigating costs of growth that are imposed over the long term are discussed, along with suggestions for alternative approaches. Despite these issues, identifying costs of growth acceleration may fill a gap in our understanding of life-history evolution: the relationships between growth rate, the environment, and fitness may contribute substantially to the diversification of life histories in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Dmitriew","given":"Caitlin M."}],"citation-key":"dmitriewEvolutionGrowthTrajectories2011","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00136.x","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2010 The Author.

Here, we have examined a Wolbachia superinfection in the mosquito Aedes albopictus and found the infection to be associated with both cytoplasmic incompatibility and increased host fecundity. Relative to uninfected females, infected females live longer, produce more eggs, and have higher hatching rates in compatible crosses.

The concept of repeatability, the measurement of consistent individual differences, has become an increasingly important tool in evolutionary and ecological physiology. Significant repeatability facilitates the study of selection acting on natural populations and the concept has several practical implications for identifying traits. 2. When properly defined and measured, repeatability can set the upper limit to heritability. This is potentially a very useful interpretation of the repeatability of traits measured on natural populations because often, estimates of heritability cannot be obtained. Many recent reports of repeatability of individual differences for traits have made this interpretation. 3. However, repeatability estimates may not set an upper limit to heritability if: (a) measured traits are not genetically identical, (b) common environmental effects work in opposition to direct genetic effects, (c) the temporary environments for each trait are negatively correlated, (d) significant genotype-environment interaction is present, or (e) the traits are influenced by maternal effects. 4. The quantitative genetic theory that defines the concept of repeatability is reviewed and implications of violations of the five assumptions are discussed in the context of interpreting repeatability as an upper estimate to heritability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dohm","given":"M.

Up to now most studies dealt with colonial species, but recent findings indicate that similar recognition is also present in non-colonial birds. By integrating spectrographic analysis and playback experiments, we investigated for the first time parent–offspring vocal recognition in the Stone Curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), a highly vocal, crepuscular-nocturnal species that usually rears a maximum of two precocial and nidifugous chicks. Even though the species is usually non-colonial and non-cooperative, in Taro River Regional Park, Parma, Italy, breeding territories are densely packed with distances between simultaneously active nests as close as 40 m, which creates the possibility that chicks might be exchanged. Our analysis identified two main vocalizations in the chick call repertoire: (1) the S-call, a brief strangled soft sound often uttered when parents and chicks were at close quarters; and (2) the C-call, a chirping sound with a complex structure, which seems to be a long-distance contact vocalization. Our acoustic analysis showed that, even though the structure was remarkably different between chicks, C-calls were an unreliable individual signature given their high intra-individual variability. This was confirmed by playback experiments. Indeed, when presented with simulated C-calling chicks, adults approached both their own and foreign chicks with equal responses. These results suggest that parent Stone Curlews are unable to recognize their offspring by voice. Furthermore, experiments are needed to test whether the chicks are able to recognize their parents' voice and, more generally, to understand the details of parent–offspring communication in this species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Dragonetti","given":"M."},{"family":"Caccamo","given":"C."},{"family":"Pollonara","given":"E."},{"family":"Baldaccini","given":"N.

The group was trained to split in half, with one subgroup composed of dominant members only, the other of subordinates. The animals were then presented the same initially novel stimuli (i.e., sand-filled metal boxes containing hidden food items) in two social contexts differing in hierarchical composition. In a combined context, all group members (i.e., both subgroups together) were simultaneously presented the stimuli. In a split context, only members of the top or bottom half of the group (i.e., each subgroup in turn) was independently presented the stimuli. Subordinates responded similarly to dominant animals in the combined context but differently in the split context, where they were far more hesitant. Rank-related differences were evident in the way animals used their home compound and in their approach and responsiveness toward the stimuli. These findings show that social context influences how animals explore novel situations, possibly reflecting different social roles or status effects on the perception of social structure. Also, despite the complexity of primate social relationships, the separation technique produced no permanent or adverse effects on the social integrity of the group.

For bird species with limited use of visual information, like species living in colonies or dense environments, the acoustic channel provides a long-distance and fast means to effectively convey identity-related information. The Rook (Corvus frugilegus) is a monogamous species, and one of the most social corvids, living in highly cohesive groups within colonies of hundreds to thousands of individuals. However, despite being a highly vocal species, only a few studies have focused on its acoustic communication skills, investigating mostly its vocal repertoire and kin recognition in fledglings. Among the vocal repertoire of the Rook, the “caw” is the most common sound type. It is emitted independently in various contexts and is often considered as a “presenting” vocalization, serving to introduce the identity of the emitter bird to the assembly. In this study, we investigated the potential individual signature of the caw. To do so, we recorded the caws of 5 semi-captive male Rooks and conducted acoustic analyses on both the frequency and time domains. A discriminant function and a potential for individuality coding analyses revealed the existence of a clear individual signature (mean of 75% correct classification, SD 10), which was mainly supported by the caw duration and distribution of energy in the low-frequency part of the spectrum. We discuss the potential variability of individuality coding across behavioral contexts and social affinities that needs further work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Dufour","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Benti","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Curé","given":"Charlotte"}],"citation-key":"dufourIndividualSignatureMost2019","container-title":"The Wilson Journal of Ornithology","container-title-short":"The Wilson Journal of Ornithology","DOI":"10.1676/18-41","ISSN":"1559-4491","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"page":"373-381","publisher":"Wilson Ornithological Society","source":"wjoonline.org (Atypon)","title":"Individual signature in the most common and context-independent call of the Rook (Corvus frugilegus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.wjoonline.org/doi/abs/10.1676/18-41","volume":"131"},{"id":"dukasCostLimitedAttention2000","abstract":"Experiments with fish and birds suggest that animals are unable to simultaneously allocate sufficient attention to tasks such as the detection of an approaching predator while searching for cryptic prey.

Several factors influencing population dynamics have already been identified. These factors can be categorized according to their level of influence. Some factors have a population-wide influence, such as climate change or population density, while others affect the individual level such as age or sex. Recently, many studies have emphasized the importance of this age structure for population dynamics.In social species, an additional level of structuring of the population is the group. However, the consequences of this social group structuring are still poorly understood.In this thesis, I try to answer this question in different ways. I first studied how the individual demographic parameters were influenced by the size and composition of the group. I was able to highlight in particular a negative effect of the number of juvenile females present during development on the probability of becoming dominant once in adulthood. In a second step, I studied the importance of interactions between groups by quantifying the impact of a change of dominant on the dispersion of subordinates. Finally, I also quantified the influence of different groups within the population showing that large groups contribute relatively less to the population growth rate.

While many studies have focused on individual condition to explain access to dominance, very few have investigated the influence of the social environment, especially during early life. Yet it is known that environmental conditions early in life may influence several traits at adulthood. Here, we examine the influence of early social environment on accession to dominance by investigating the influence of litter size and sex composition on survival and the probability of ascending to dominance later in life using a 20-year dataset from a wild population of Alpine marmots (Marmota marmota). Although litter size had no effect on the fate of individuals, litter sex composition affected male juvenile survival and both male and female probabilities of reaching dominant status when adult. Male juveniles incur lower survival when the number of male juveniles in the litter increases, and individuals of both sexes from male-biased litters are more likely to become dominant than individuals from female-biased litters. However, the absolute number of sisters in the litter, rather than the sex ratio, seems to be an important predictor of the probability of acquiring dominant status: pups having more sisters are less likely to become dominant. Several potential mechanisms to explain these results are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Dupont","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Pradel","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Lardy","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"}],"citation-key":"dupontLitterSexComposition2015","container-title":"Oecologia","container-title-short":"Oecologia","DOI":"10.1007/s00442-015-3375-6","ISSN":"1432-1939","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"753-763","source":"Springer Link","title":"Litter sex composition influences dominance status of Alpine marmots (Marmota marmota)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3375-6","volume":"179"},{"id":"dyerEvolutionarilyStableInfection2004","abstract":"Maternally inherited microbes that spread via male-killing are common pathogens of insects, yet very little is known about the evolutionary duration of these associations.

A male-killing strain of Wolbachia has recently been discovered in natural populations of Drosophila innubila. The population-level effects of this infection are significant: ∼35% of females are infected, infected females produce very strongly female-biased sex ratios, and the resulting population-level sex ratio is significantly female biased. Using data on infection prevalence and Wolbachia transmission rates, infected cytoplasmic lineages are estimated to experience a ∼5% selective advantage relative to uninfected lineages. The evolutionary history of this infection was explored by surveying patterns of polymorphism in both the host and parasite genomes, comparing the Wolbachia wsp gene and the host mtDNA COI gene to five host nuclear genes. Molecular data suggest that this male-killing infection is evolutionarily old, a conclusion supported with a simple model of parasite and mtDNA transmission dynamics. Despite a large effective population size of the host species and strong selection to evolve resistance, the D. innubila-Wolbachia association is likely at a stable equilibrium that is maintained by imperfect maternal transmission of the bacteria rather than partial resistance in the host species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Dyer","given":"Kelly A"},{"family":"Jaenike","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"dyerEvolutionarilyStableInfection2004","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.104.027854","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",11,1]]},"page":"1443-1455","source":"Silverchair","title":"Evolutionarily Stable Infection by a Male-Killing Endosymbiont in Drosophila innubilaSequence data from this article have been deposited with the EMBL/GenBank Data Libraries under accession nos.

First, we looked at individual differences in song characteristics between males of the European starling, and we related song behaviour to factors such as male age, pairing date, polygyny and male breeding success. Second, we experimentally tested whether song has an effect on female mating decisions. 1. During the breeding season, male starlings sing a very long and complex song consisting of a rapid succession of large number of different song types. We observed marked differences between males in average song bout length (a song bout was defined as a period of at least five seconds of song containing no pauses larger than 1.5 seconds) and in song repertoire size. Average song bout lengths ranged from 16 to 35 seconds. The individual repertoire size ranged from 23 to 67 song types. Repertoire size and average song bout length were positively correlated. 2. Both in the field and in captivity, yearling males sang shorter average song bout lengths and had smaller repertoire sizes than older males. 3. Males singing longer average song bouts and having larger repertoire sizes attracted females for pairing before their rivals with shorter average song bouts and smaller repertoire sizes. 4. Repertoire size and average song bout length were positively correlated with the number of females attracted and with male breeding success. The correlation between average song bout length and male breeding success remained when yearling males were excluded from the analysis. 5. Choice-experiments carried out in large outdour aviaries indicated that females mated significantly more often with males having larger repertoire sizes and singing longer average song bouts. 6. The overall results indicate that male song characteristics influence female mating decisions in the starling. It is concluded that the complex male song in the European starling has probably evolved as a result of intersexual selection by female choice. Finally, the possible role of song characteristics on female mate choice in the context of extra-pair copulations in songbirds is discussed. /// Cette recherche avait deux objectifs. D'abord nous avons etudié les différences individuelles dans les caractéristiques du chant parmi les mâles de l'étourneau sansonnet et nous avons relié le comportement du chant à des facteurs comme l'âge du male, la date de formation du couple, la polygynie et le succès de couvaison du mâle. Après nous avons testé expérimentalement si le chant a un effet sur les décisions d'accouplement de la femelle. 1. Pendant la saison de reproduction, les étourneaux mâles chantent un chant très long et complex composé d'une succession rapide d'un grand nombre de motifs différents (Figure 1 et 2). Nous avons observés des différences frappantes entre mâles dans la durée moyenne de leurs séquences de chant (une séquence de chant était définié comme une période d'au moins cinq secondes contenants des repos de moins d'une seconde et demie) et dans la taille du répertoire. La durée moyenne de séquences de chant variait de 16 à 35 secondes. La taille du répertoire variait de 23 à 67 motifs différents. La taille du répertoire et la durée moyenne de séquences de chant correspondaient positivement. 2. Aussi bien dans le champ qu'en captivité les mâles de première année chantaient des séquences de chant plus courtes et avaient des tailles de répertoires plus petits que les mâles plus agés. 3. Les mâles chantant des séquences de chants plus longues et ayant des tailles de répertoires plus grandes, attiraient des femelles pour l'accouplement avant leurs rivaux qui avaient des séquences de chant plus courtes et des tailles de répertoires plus petits. 4. La taille du répertoire et la durée moyenne des séquences de chant correspondaient positivement avec le nombre de femelles attirées et avec le succès de couvaison du mâle. La relation entre la durée moyenne des séquences de chant et le succès de couvaison du mâle était indépendant de l'âge du mâle. 5. Des expériments de choix exécutés dans de volières en plein air indiquaient que les femelles s'accouplaient significativement plus souvent avec des mâles ayant des tailles de répertoire plus grandes et chantants des séquences de chant en moyenne plus longues. 6. Les résultats globaux indiquent que les caractéristiques du chant du mâle influencent les décisions d'accouplement de la femelle de l'étourneau. Il est conclu que le chant complex du mâle de l'étourneau sansonnet a évolué probablement comme un résultat de la sélection intersexuelle du choix de la femelle. Le rôle possible des caractéristiques du chant sur le choix du partenaire de la femelle est discuté dans le contexte des accouplements extraconjugaux chez les passereaux.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Eens","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Pinxten","given":"Rianne"},{"family":"Verheyen","given":"Rudolf Frans"}],"citation-key":"eensMaleSongCue1991","container-title":"Behaviour","ISSN":"0005-7959","issue":"3/4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"page":"210-238","publisher":"Brill","source":"JSTOR","title":"Male Song as a Cue for Mate Choice in the European Starling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534919","volume":"116"},{"id":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Elie","given":"Julie E."},{"family":"Theunissen","given":"Frédéric E."}],"citation-key":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-06394-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"4026","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zebra finches identify individuals using vocal signatures unique to each call type","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06394-9","volume":"9"},{"id":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Elie","given":"Julie E."},{"family":"Theunissen","given":"Frédéric E."}],"citation-key":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018a","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-06394-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"4026","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zebra finches identify individuals using vocal signatures unique to each call type","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06394-9","volume":"9"},{"id":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018b","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Elie","given":"Julie E."},{"family":"Theunissen","given":"Frédéric E."}],"citation-key":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018b","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-06394-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"4026","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zebra finches identify individuals using vocal signatures unique to each call type","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06394-9","volume":"9"},{"id":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018c","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Elie","given":"Julie E."},{"family":"Theunissen","given":"Frédéric E."}],"citation-key":"elieZebraFinchesIdentify2018c","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-06394-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"4026","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zebra finches identify individuals using vocal signatures unique to each call type","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06394-9","volume":"9"},{"id":"ellisVocalRepertoireWhitethroated2008","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Ellis","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"ellisVocalRepertoireWhitethroated2008","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"publisher":"Cornell University","title":"The vocal repertoire of the white-throated magpie-jay (Calocitta formosa)","type":"thesis","URL":"https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/9484/DISS6.pdf?sequence=1"},{"id":"emeryCognitiveAdaptationsSocial2007","abstract":"The ‘social intelligence hypothesis’ was originally conceived to explain how primates may have evolved their superior intellect and large brains when compared with other animals. Although some birds such as corvids may be intellectually comparable to apes, the same relationship between sociality and brain size seen in primates has not been found for birds, possibly suggesting a role for other non-social factors. But bird sociality is different from primate sociality. Most monkeys and apes form stable groups, whereas most birds are monogamous, and only form large flocks outside of the breeding season. Some birds form lifelong pair bonds and these species tend to have the largest brains relative to body size. Some of these species are known for their intellectual abilities (e.g. corvids and parrots), while others are not (e.g. geese and albatrosses). Although socio-ecological factors may explain some of the differences in brain size and intelligence between corvids/parrots and geese/albatrosses, we predict that the type and quality of the bonded relationship is also critical. Indeed, we present empirical evidence that rook and jackdaw partnerships resemble primate and dolphin alliances. Although social interactions within a pair may seem simple on the surface, we argue that cognition may play an important role in the maintenance of long-term relationships, something we name as ‘relationship intelligence’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Emery","given":"Nathan J"},{"family":"Seed","given":"Amanda M"},{"family":"Bayern","given":"Auguste M.P","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Clayton","given":"Nicola S"}],"citation-key":"emeryCognitiveAdaptationsSocial2007","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

However, corvids and parrots, which have forebrains relatively the same size as apes, live in complex social groups and have a long developmental period before becoming independent, have demonstrated ape-like intelligence. Although, ornithologists have documented thousands of hours observing birds in their natural habitat, they have focused their attention on avian behaviour and ecology, rather than intelligence. This review discusses recent studies of avian cognition contrasting two different approaches; the anthropocentric approach and the adaptive specialization approach. It is argued that the most productive method is to combine the two approaches. This is discussed with respects to recent investigations of two supposedly unique aspects of human cognition; episodic memory and theory of mind. In reviewing the evidence for avian intelligence, corvids and parrots appear to be cognitively superior to other birds and in many cases even apes. This suggests that complex cognition has evolved in species with very different brains through a process of convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry, although the notion that birds and mammals may share common neural connectivity patterns is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Emery","given":"Nathan J"}],"citation-key":"emeryCognitiveOrnithologyEvolution2006","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

The function, evolution and neurobiology of gaze processing are therefore of interest to a number of researchers. This review discusses the evolutionary role of social gaze in vertebrates (focusing on primates), and a hypothesis that this role has changed substantially for primates compared to other animals. This change may have been driven by morphological changes to the face and eyes of primates, limitations in the facial anatomy of other vertebrates, changes in the ecology of the environment in which primates live, and a necessity to communicate information about the environment, emotional and mental states. The eyes represent different levels of signal value depending on the status, disposition and emotional state of the sender and receiver of such signals. There are regions in the monkey and human brain which contain neurons that respond selectively to faces, bodies and eye gaze. The ability to follow another individual's gaze direction is affected in individuals with autism and other psychopathological disorders, and after particular localized brain lesions. The hypothesis that gaze following is “hard-wired” in the brain, and may be localized within a circuit linking the superior temporal sulcus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Emery","given":"N.

We estimated the colour preferences in a wild population of great bowerbirds using artificially coloured objects widely spaced in bird colour space. We found that these birds prefer colours that contrast with their own plumage, the bower structure and the visual backgrounds adjacent to the bower, and that they have very strong dislikes for colours that are similar to their own plumage and to the visual backgrounds. The range of disliked colour hues was much narrower than the range of preferred hues, suggesting that the word ‘preference’ may be misleading.

Annual fitness selection on forehead patch size switched from positive to negative during the study, a reversal that is accounted for by rising spring temperatures at the breeding site: highly ornamented males were selectively favoured following cold breeding seasons but selected against following warm breeding seasons. An ‘individual animal model’ describes a decline in the genetic values of breeding males during the study, which simulations showed was unlikely to result from drift alone.

We tested predictions concerning (i) a sex effect in a monogamous non-dimorphic species, (ii) age structure of survival rates in a mesomammal, and (iii) the annual variability effect and the contribution of stochastic climatic factors, especially snow cover, frost, and rainfall. We used a 8-year dataset of 367 marmots that were livetrapped and marked in La Sassière Nature Reserve in the French Alps between 1990 and 1997. Survival and recapture rates were modelled using recent developments in capture–recapture models. Sex had no effect on survival rates, which agrees with the predictions of sexual selection. Survival rates for young of the year (YOY, from weaning to first birthday) were, on average, lower than in the older age class. In the older age class, annual variation occurred that was strongly related to the intensity of autumn frost. By determining the soil temperature at the beginning of hibernation, this factor, though short-lived, could have determined the energetic cost of hibernation. Neither annual variation nor an environmental effect was detected in YOY despite a large sample size. Social thermoregulation could contribute to the stability of YOY survival rates. As infanticide was common after the immigration of a new dominant male, survival of YOY seemed to depend more on social events than on stochastic climatic ones. Résumé : Nous 3av4o9ns étudié les variations des taux annuels de survie dans une population de marmottes alpines (Marmota marmota). Les taux de survie ont été étudiés en fonction de facteurs intrinsèques (sexe et âge) et extrinsèques (années et climat). Nous avons testé des prédictions sur (i) l’effet du sexe chez une espèce monogame non dimorphique, (ii) la structuration en âge de ce mésomammifère et (iii) l’effet de la variabilité annuelle et la contribution de facteurs climatiques, en particulier le couvert neigeux, le gel et les précipitations. Nous avons utilisé un jeu de données de 8 ans portant sur 367 marmottes qui ont été capturées et marquées dans la réserve de la Sassière (Alpes françaises, à 2350 m d’altitude) entre 1990 et 1997. Les taux de survie et de recapture ont été modélisés à partir des modèles récents de capture–recapture. Le sexe n’avait pas d’effet sur la survie, ce qui est en accord avec la prédiction de la sélection sexuelle. La survie des jeunes de l’année (du sevrage au premier anniversaire) était plus faible que celle des animaux plus âgés. Dans cette dernière classe, les variations annuelles de survie étaient liées à l’intensité du gel automnal. Parce qu’elle était responsable de la température du sol au début de l’hibernation, cette courte période pouvait sans doute déterminer le coût de l’hibernation. La survie des jeunes de l’année ne dépendait ni de l’année ni d’effets environnementaux, bien que la taille de l’échantillon se soit avérée importante. La thermorégulation sociale pourrait contribuer à stabiliser la survie des jeunes de l’année.

However, data on the early stages of developing stereotypies are currently scarce. We compared the development of stereotypic route-tracing and somersaulting in hand-reared and wild-caught starlings placed in individual cages for the first time. We found that wild-caught birds were less active but showed more escape motivation and more evidence of route-tracing behavior. Furthermore, somersaulting was only observed in wild-caught birds. Development of somersaulting was predicted by subtle differences in behavior during the first few days in cages and developed in individuals with low levels of route-tracing behavior. Our data suggest a role for escape motivation in the development of starling stereotypies and additionally that route-tracing and somersaulting may represent alternative outlets for thwarted escape.

Scanning behaviour is often incorporated in theoretical models using simplifying assumptions in relation to the trade-off in information gathering between body postures (head-up versus head-down); however, some avian visual systems may allow individuals to scan in both body postures. We studied these issues experimentally, using starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, foraging in enclosures on natural fields. We varied the availability of information from conspecifics by placing visual barriers that blocked the view when the subjects were in head-down position and by manipulating the distance between group members. We found that as social information was reduced, starlings spent more time scanning (on and off the ground) and head-up scanning was mainly oriented towards conspecifics. The visual-obstruction effects imply that some information about conspecifics is normally gathered while starlings are foraging head-down. Neighbour distance and visual obstruction negatively affected food-searching rates and intake rates in two ways: (1) the effect of obstruction was mediated mostly through time competition between foraging and scanning on the ground, and (2) the effect of distance was due to a reduction in the rate of prey returns per searching effort while the birds were head-down. We conclude that the head-up posture is only one component of scanning, that the effects of head-down scanning should also be considered in species with ample visual fields, and that scanning in starlings is strongly connected to monitoring other flock members.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernández-Juricic","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Kacelnik","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"fernandez-juricicIncreasingCostsConspecific2005","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.01.019","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"73-81","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Increasing the costs of conspecific scanning in socially foraging starlings affects vigilance and foraging behaviour","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347204003318","volume":"69"},{"id":"ferrandiz-roviraNeighborhoodBullyNo2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            Territorial animals are expected to adjust their response to intruders according to the perceived threat level. One of the factors that drives threat level is the identity of the intruder. The dear enemy phenomenon theory postulates that individuals should respond with lower intensity to neighbors, already possessing a territory, than to strangers that may fight to evict them. In social species, the hierarchical status of the intruder might also mediate this response. Such behavioral adjustments presuppose a capacity to discriminate between individuals posing different threat levels. Here, we tested the behavioral response of Alpine marmots to territorial intrusions in a wild population. We compared both dominant females’ and males’ responses to scents from neighbor and stranger dominant males (dear enemy phenomenon) and to dominant and subordinate stranger males (social status-specific response). In addition, we tested for any covariance between male scents and social status. We showed that female and male dominant marmots do not adjust the intensity of their behavioral responses to whether the intruder’s territory is bordering or not (neighbors or strangers) or to the intruder’s social status, even though dominant and subordinate males are thought to pose different threats and social status is encoded in scents. Thus, we did not find support for the dear enemy phenomenon and conclude instead that, in dominant Alpine marmots, no intruder should enter a foreign territory. Research taking a more holistic approach of the evolution and maintenance of territoriality is required to understand the flexibility of responses to intruders in group-living species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrandiz-Rovira","given":"Mariona"},{"family":"Zidat","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Dupont","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Vérane"},{"family":"Rézouki","given":"Célia"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"}],"citation-key":"ferrandiz-roviraNeighborhoodBullyNo2020","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/araa061","editor":[{"family":"Barrett","given":"Louise"}],"ISSN":"1045-2249, 1465-7279","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1129-1141","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neighborhood bully: no difference in territorial response toward neighbors or strangers in marmots","title-short":"Neighborhood bully","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/31/5/1129/5867209","volume":"31"},{"id":"fettermanDimensionsStimulusComplexity","author":[{"family":"Fetterman","given":"J Gregor"}],"citation-key":"fettermanDimensionsStimulusComplexity","language":"en","page":"16","source":"Zotero","title":"Dimensions of Stimulus Complexity","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"fettermanDimensionsStimulusComplexity1996","abstract":"Animal reaming research has increasingly used complex stimuli that approximate natural objects, events, and locations, a trend that has accompanied a resurgence of interest in the role of cognitive factors in reaming.

But depending on whether endotherms are hibernating or active, the same changes in Ta may have opposing consequences for their energy consumption. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how variations in Ta, occurring during hibernation and during the active period of a hibernator, affect different fitness relevant traits. To understand whether changes in Ta impact phenology, body mass and reproduction in a small mammalian hibernator, we analysed Ta variations and detailed capture–mark–recapture data on edible dormice Glis glis collected between 1993 and 2016 in South-West Germany. Results revealed that during hibernation a Ta increase of 1°C advanced the date of first capture after hibernation by 6 days, but only if food availability during the preceding year was low. In contrast, after years of comparatively high food availability, date of first capture was not affected by Ta, but dormice had a significantly lower body mass after emergence, if Ta during hibernation was elevated (3–6 g per 1°C). We presume that an earlier emergence as well as a lower body mass after emergence potentially reduces the chance to survive. During the active period of edible dormice, mean spring Ta did not affect the date of birth but was positively associated with litter size, potentially improving reproductive success. Results of this study highlight that, depending on the physiological state of a hibernator, an increase in Ta can have positive and negative effects on fitness relevant traits.

However, these scenarios are hard to reconcile simultaneously with Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) and the Price identity (PI). The consideration of indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on fitness reconciles these fundamental theorems with the observation that traits sometimes evolve without any adaptation by explicitly considering the correlated evolution of the social environment, which is a form of transmission bias. Although environmental change is often assumed to be absent when using the PI, here we show that explicitly considering IGEs as change in the social environment with implications for fitness has several benefits: (1) it makes clear how traits can evolve while mean fitness remains stationary, (2) it reconciles the FTNS with the evolution of maladaptation, (3) it explicitly includes density-dependent fitness through negative social effects that depend on the number of interacting conspecifics, and (4) it allows mean fitness to evolve even when direct genetic variance in fitness is zero, if related individuals interact and/or if there is multilevel selection. In summary, considering fitness in the context of IGEs aligns important theorems of natural selection with many situations observed in nature and provides a useful lens through which we might better understand evolution and adaptation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Fisher","given":"David N."},{"family":"McAdam","given":"Andrew G."}],"citation-key":"fisherIndirectGeneticEffects2019","container-title":"Evolution Letters","DOI":"10.1002/evl3.98","ISSN":"2056-3744","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"4-14","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Indirect genetic effects clarify how traits can evolve even when fitness does not","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/3/1/4/6697305","volume":"3"},{"id":"forestPubPeerContreFake2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Forest","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"forestPubPeerContreFake2018","container-title":"Ethics, Medicine and Public Health","container-title-short":"Ethics, Medicine and Public Health","DOI":"10.1016/j.jemep.2018.01.009","ISSN":"23525525","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"language":"fr","page":"9-11","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"PubPeer contre “fake news” en Sciences ?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352552518300094","volume":"4"},{"id":"forsmanFearfulSymmetryPattern1999","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Forsman","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Merilaita","given":"Sami"}],"citation-key":"forsmanFearfulSymmetryPattern1999","container-title":"Evolutionary Ecology","container-title-short":"Evolutionary Ecology","DOI":"10.1023/A:1006630911975","ISSN":"0269-7653, 1573-8477","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","page":"131-140","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fearful symmetry: pattern size and asymmetry affects aposematic signal efficacy","title-short":"Fearful symmetry","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1023/A:1006630911975","volume":"13"},{"id":"foxAppliedRegressionAnalysis2015","abstract":"Combining a modern, data-analytic perspective with a focus on applications in the social sciences, the Third Edition of Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models provides in-depth coverage of regression analysis, generalized linear models, and closely related methods, such as bootstrapping and missing data.

Call-independent identification does not involve direct comparison of a particular song type. It can therefore be carried out regardless of the amount of song sharing between individuals, or changes in an individual's repertoire over time. This wide applicability radically expands the range of situations in which acoustic individual identification can be used. Text-independent recognition is routinely conducted on human speech and in this paper the same techniques, using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and multilayer perceptrons, were applied to bird song. Call-independent identification accuracies ranged from 54.3-75.7% in three passerine species. To suit bird song better, we modified the feature extraction methods and neural network architecture, resulting in accuracies of 69.3-97.1%. A comparison of call-dependent and call-independent identification showed little difference in accuracy for two species, while the third species had a lower accuracy for the call-independent identification.

We therefore wondered whether she could also influence its laterality. To see whether mothering influences the chick's laterality, we compared behaviours of nonbrooded and brooded domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus. We assessed both individual and group level laterality during the mothering period. We also measured sociality and emotivity of both types of chicks. We found that nonbrooded chicks were more strongly lateralized, more social and less emotional than brooded chicks. Asymmetrical bias was also more consistent across nonbrooded chicks than across brooded chicks. These results show a postnatal influence of mothering on the development of laterality in the domestic chick, and a link between laterality and sociality. Several hypotheses could explain how the mother's presence and behaviour can modify her offspring's laterality. We need to test these hypotheses to uncover the mechanisms that are at play. The influence of mothering on the lateralization of young may have implications in both individual and group performance and fitness. Studying it further may therefore help us to understand better the evolution of laterality and its potential benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Galuret","given":"Soline"},{"family":"Lumineau","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Pouzol","given":"Damien"},{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"galuretMotheringInfluencesDomestic2020","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.11.005","ISSN":"0003-3472","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"69-79","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mothering influences domestic chick's laterality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347219303653","volume":"159"},{"id":"gamberale-stilleContrastColourAposematic2003","abstract":"Conspicuousness is an important feature of warning coloration. One hypothesis for its function is that it increases signal efficacy by facilitating avoidance learning. An alternative, based on the handicap hypothesis, suggests that the degree of conspicuousness holds information directly about the quality of the prey, and that predators associate and learn about the conspicuousness of the coloration, and not the actual colour pattern. We studied the relative importance of signal contrast and the colours of signals for predator attention during discrimination. We used young chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, as predators and small blue or red paper cones on either matching or contrasting paper backgrounds as stimuli associated with palatable or unpalatable chick crumbs. In four treatment groups, birds could use either cone and/or background colour, cone colour only, background colour only or cone-to-background contrast as cues for discrimination. Only birds in the contrast treatment failed to learn their discrimination task. Birds that had a choice between cone and background colour as cues used the cone colour and they learned the task faster than did birds that had to use background colour as a cue. The results suggest that birds primarily attend to the colours of signals and disregard contrast in discrimination tasks; they thus fail to support a handicap function of conspicuous aposematic coloration.

We only found support for maternal genetic effect variance in the two neonatal morphological traits: birth weight (hMg2 = 0.31) and birth leg length (hMg2 = 0.17). For these two traits, the genetic correlation between maternal and direct additive effects was not significantly different from zero, indicating no constraint to evolution from genetic architecture. In contrast, variance in maternal genetic effects enhanced the additive genetic variance available to respond to natural selection. Maternal effect variance was negligible for late-life traits. We found no evidence for sex differences in either the direct or maternal genetic architecture of offspring traits.

Plus de 300 000 ordinateurs furent infectés par le ransomware Wannacry dans deux cents pays différents. Les systèmes informatiques de la banque centrale de Russie, ceux du National Health Center aux États-Unis, des entreprises comme Vodafone, Fedex, Renault et même ceux d’un centre hospitalier britannique, ainsi qu’une partie de l’appareillage médical connecté, furent paralysés durant plusieurs heures, voire plusieurs jours en fonction des cas. Le logiciel utilisé pour infecter les systèmes victimes de l’attaque verrouillait l’accès aux données des utilisateurs et réclamait une rançon en échange du déblocage des bases de données ainsi prises en otage, d’où le terme utilisé pour qualifier ce type d’application – ransomware, « rançonlogiciel » – et le nom utilisé pour qualifier celui-ci en particulier : Wannacry, « Tu veux pleurer ? »Ce type d’attaque n’était pourtant pas une première mais le phénomène n’avait jamais eu lieu à l’échelle de la planète entière, faisant des victimes aussi bien en France qu’au Royaume-Uni, en Russie ou en Asie. Le logiciel Wannacry lui-même avait été dérobé à la toute puissante NSA, la National Security Agency, et divulgué en ligne le 14 avril 2017 par un groupe de pirates informatiques prénommés Shadow brokers.","author":[{"family":"Gayard","given":"Laurent"}],"citation-key":"gayardDarknetGAFABitcoin2018","ISBN":"978-2-88944-089-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,10]]},"language":"fr","number-of-pages":"330","publisher":"Slatkine & Cie","source":"Google Books","title":"Darknet, GAFA, Bitcoin: L'anonymat est un choix","title-short":"Darknet, GAFA, Bitcoin","type":"book"},{"id":"gayardDarknetGAFABitcoin2018a","abstract":"Si internet est gratuit, c'est que c'est vous le produit.

This strategy can lead to algorithms that are much less susceptible to becoming stuck near zero values of the variance parameters than are more standard algorithms. Second, we consider a simple rotation of the regression coefficients based on an estimate of their posterior covariance matrix. This leads to a Gibbs algorithm based on updating the transformed parameters one at a time or a Metropolis algorithm with vector jumps; either of these algorithms can perform much better (in terms of total CPU time) than the two standard algorithms: one-at-a-time updating of untransformed parameters or vector updating using a linear regression at each step. We present an innovative evaluation of the algorithms in terms of how quickly they can get away from remote areas of parameter space, along with some more standard evaluation of computation and convergence speeds. We illustrate our methods with examples from our applied work.

Nowhere is this clearer than in our ability to learn relational categories like gift, weapon, predator, or central force system. By relational categories, I mean categories whose meanings consist either of (a) relations with other entities, as in predator or gift, or (b) internal relations among a set of components, as in robbery or central force system. My purpose here is, first, to discuss relational categories and how they are learned, and second, to discuss how children learn relational information about object categories. Relational categories contrast with object categories' (e.g., tiger or cow), whose members share intrinsic features, often including perceptual commonalities. Of course, object categories typically '- contain not only property information but also relational information. For example, that tigers hunt and eat animals is part of our concept of a tiger, along with intrinsic attributes such as their stripes. I return to the role of relational information in ordinary object categories later.

This study presents a novel technique for assaying directly female preference and choice in European starlings by using the presentation of conspecific male song as an operant reinforcer in a controlled environment. Using an apparatus in which the playback of songs from different nestboxes is under the operant control of the subject, we demonstrate how the reinforcing properties of conspecific song can be used to measure female preference and choice. The results of the study suggest three conclusions. First, female starlings prefer naturally ordered conspecific male songs over reversed songs. Second, female starlings display robust preferences for longer compared with shorter male song bouts. Behaviour in the operant apparatus varied directly with male song bout length. Third, preferences based on song bout length are sex specific. Male starlings failed to respond differentially to the same stimuli for which females showed strong preferences. These results suggest that male–male variation in song bout length is important for mate choice among starlings. In addition, we detail the use of a novel behavioural assay for measuring female preferences that can be applied to similar behaviours in other species of songbirds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Gentner","given":"Timothy Q."},{"family":"Hulse","given":"Stewart H."}],"citation-key":"gentnerFemaleEuropeanStarling2000a","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1006/anbe.1999.1313","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"443-458","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Female European starling preference and choice for variation in conspecific male song","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347299913131","volume":"59"},{"id":"gentnerIndividualVocalRecognition1999","author":[{"family":"Gentner","given":"Timothy Q"},{"family":"Hulse","given":"Stewart H"},{"family":"Bentley","given":"George E"},{"family":"Ball","given":"Gregory F"}],"citation-key":"gentnerIndividualVocalRecognition1999","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Individual vocal recognition and the effect of partial lesions to HVc on discrimination, learning, and categorization of conspecific song in adult songbirds","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"gentnerIndividualVocalRecognition2000","abstract":"Among songbirds, the capacity to associate particular songs with particular singers (i.e., vocal recognition) forms the cognitive basis for more complex communication behaviors such as female choice and territoriality. In the present study, we combine operant conditioning techniques and excitotoxic lesions to the forebrain nucleus HVc to examine the role of this region in the discrimination, associative learning, and categorization of conspecific song. We trained adult male and female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to recognize simultaneously the songs of several conspecific males. Then, using a series of transfer procedures, we demonstrate that correct recognition does not generalize to song bouts containing novel motifs from familiar singers. This suggests that starlings do not make use of individually invariant source or filter characteristics for vocal recognition. We then lesioned a portion of HVc bilaterally with ibotenic acid, and exposed the birds to a series of manipulations testing the discrimination, associative learning, and categorization of conspecific song. The lesions attenuated song production among males, but retention of the basic recognition task (i.e., maintenance of the discrimination) was unaffected. However, when the response contingencies were reversed—as a test of associative learning independent of discrimination—the initial performance and subsequent learning rate were negatively correlated with the size of the HVc lesions. This suggests that HVc plays a role in the formation of associations between a song and some referent.

This chapter summarizes the research effort to identify the brain regions and mechanisms mediating individual song recognition in European starlings, a species of songbird. The results of laboratory behavioral studies are reviewed, which show that when adult starlings learn to recognize other individual’s songs, they do so by memorizing large sets of song elements, called motifs. Recent data from single neurons in the caudal medial portion of the mesopallium are then reviewed, showing that song recognition learning leads to explicit representation of acoustic features that correspond closely to specific motifs, but only to motifs in the songs that birds have learned to recognize. This suggests that the strength and tuning of high-level auditory object representations, of the sort that presumably underlie many forms of vocal communication, are shaped by each animal’s unique experience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gentner","given":"T Q"}],"citation-key":"gentnerNeuralSystemsIndividual2004","container-title":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1196/annals.1298.008","ISSN":"00778923, 17496632","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",6]]},"language":"en","page":"282-302","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neural Systems for Individual Song Recognition in Adult Birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1196/annals.1298.008","volume":"1016"},{"id":"gentnerPerceptualClassificationBased2000","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gentner","given":"Timothy Q."},{"family":"Hulse","given":"Stewart H."}],"citation-key":"gentnerPerceptualClassificationBased2000","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","container-title-short":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.429408","ISSN":"0001-4966","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",6]]},"language":"en","page":"3369-3381","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perceptual classification based on the component structure of song in European starlings","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.429408","volume":"107"},{"id":"gentnerPerceptualMechanismsIndividual1998","abstract":"The capacity for vocal recognition of individual conspecifics is well documented in many species, but the perceptual mechanisms that underlie this ability in oscines are less well understood.

Familiarity appears to be tightly linked to multisensory integration. The ability to differentiate and categorize familiar and unfamiliar individuals and to build a multisensory representation of known individuals emerges from successive social interactions, in particular with adult, experienced models. In different species, adults have been shown to shape the social behavior of young by promoting selective attention to multisensory cues. The question of what representation of known conspecifics adult-deprived animals may build therefore arises. Here we show that starlings raised with no experience with adults fail to develop a multisensory representation of familiar and unfamiliar starlings. Electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity throughout the primary auditory area of these birds, while they were exposed to audio-only or audiovisual familiar and unfamiliar cues, showed that visual stimuli did, as in wild-caught starlings, modulate auditory responses but that, unlike what was observed in wild-caught birds, this modulation was not influenced by familiarity. Thus, adult-deprived starlings seem to fail to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar individuals. This suggests that adults may shape multisensory representation of known individuals in the brain, possibly by focusing the young’s attention on relevant, multisensory cues. Multisensory stimulation by experienced, adult models may thus be ubiquitously important for the development of social skills (and of the neural properties underlying such skills) in a variety of species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"}],"citation-key":"georgeExperienceAdultsShapes2012","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0038764","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e38764","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Experience with Adults Shapes Multisensory Representation of Social Familiarity in the Brain of a Songbird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038764","volume":"7"},{"id":"georgeHemisphericSpecializationPrimary2004","abstract":"Although evidence exists for a lateralization of song production, few studies have focused on the perceptual aspect of lateralization in songbirds.

Among animals that have been shown to be able of categorization, songbirds are particularly interesting because they provide researchers with clear examples of categories of acoustic signals allowing different levels of recognition, and they possess a system of specialized brain structures found only in birds that learn to sing: the song system. Moreover, an avian brain nucleus that is analogous to the mammalian secondary auditory cortex (the caudo-medial nidopallium, or NCM) has recently emerged as a plausible site for sensory representation of birdsong, and appears as a well positioned brain region for categorization of songs. Hence, we tested responses in this non-primary, associative area to clear and distinct classes of songs with different functions and social values, and for a possible correspondence between these responses and the functional aspects of songs, in a highly social songbird species: the European starling. Our results clearly show differential neuronal responses to the ethologically defined classes of songs, both in the number of neurons responding, and in the response magnitude of these neurons. Most importantly, these differential responses corresponded to the functional classes of songs, with increasing activation from non-specific to species-specific and from species-specific to individual-specific sounds. These data therefore suggest a potential neural substrate for sorting natural communication signals into categories, and for individual vocal recognition of same-species members. Given the many parallels that exist between birdsong and speech, these results may contribute to a better understanding of the neural bases of speech.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"}],"citation-key":"georgePotentialNeuralSubstrate2008","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0002203","editor":[{"family":"Giurfa","given":"Martin"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e2203","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Potential Neural Substrate for Processing Functional Classes of Complex Acoustic Signals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002203","volume":"3"},{"id":"georgePotentialNeuralSubstrate2008a","author":[{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"}],"citation-key":"georgePotentialNeuralSubstrate2008a","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0002203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"A Potential Neural Substrate for Processing Functional Classes of Complex Acoustic Signals","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},{"id":"georgeStatedependentHemisphericSpecialization2005","abstract":"Lateralization of brain functions is a widespread phenomenon in vertebrates. With the well-known lateralization in the processing of human speech and the parallels that exist between birdsong and language, songbirds are interesting for addressing such questions. In the present study, we investigated the central processing of communicative and artificial sounds in starlings, in an integrative part of the song system: the HVC. Neuronal responses to acoustic stimuli were systematically recorded in both hemispheres while the birds were awake, and then anesthetized, allowing quantitative comparisons of the responses obtained in each situation. The total proportion of responsive sites in the HVC of the left and right hemispheres of all birds revealed a significant predominance of the HVC of the right hemisphere when the birds were awake, whereas a high interindividual variability appeared when the birds were anesthetized. When neuronal responses as a whole were further examined, the responses to each type of stimulus appeared to be nonrandomly distributed over the different situations, and some specialization may appear. The results suggest a complex and state-dependent hemispheric specialization toward behaviorally relevant classes of stimuli. In awake birds, the HVC of the left hemisphere may be more involved in the processing of songs that are used in individual recognition at distance, whereas the HVC of the right hemisphere may deal with long and complex sequences of a song that is involved in short-distance communication, especially between males and females.

Because plasticity encompasses diverse adaptive and non-adaptive responses to environmental variation, no single conceptual framework adequately predicts the diverse roles of plasticity in evolutionary change. 2 Different types of phenotypic plasticity can uniquely contribute to adaptive evolution when populations are faced with new or altered environments. Adaptive plasticity should promote establishment and persistence in a new environment, but depending on how close the plastic response is to the new favoured phenotypic optimum dictates whether directional selection will cause adaptive divergence between populations. Further, non-adaptive plasticity in response to stressful environments can result in a mean phenotypic response being further away from the favoured optimum or alternatively increase the variance around the mean due to the expression of cryptic genetic variation. The expression of cryptic genetic variation can facilitate adaptive evolution if by chance it results in a fitter phenotype. 3 We conclude that adaptive plasticity that places populations close enough to a new phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time-scales in new environments. However, this type of plasticity is likely to be the product of past selection on variation that may have been initially non-adaptive. 4 We end with suggestions on how future empirical studies can be designed to better test the importance of different kinds of plasticity to adaptive evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghalambor","given":"C.

We reviewed the empirical evidence for recent microevolutionary responses to climate change in longitudinal studies emphasizing the following three perspectives emerging from the published data. First, although signatures of climate change are clearly visible in many ecological processes, similar examples of microevolutionary responses in literature are in fact very rare. Second, the quality of evidence for microevolutionary responses to climate change is far from satisfactory as the documented responses are often — if not typically — based on nongenetic data. We reinforce the view that it is as important to make the distinction between genetic (evolutionary) and phenotypic (includes a nongenetic, plastic component) responses clear, as it is to understand the relative roles of plasticity and genetics in adaptation to climate change. Third, in order to illustrate the difficulties and their potential ubiquity in detection of microevolution in response to natural selection, we reviewed the quantitative genetic studies on microevolutionary responses to natural selection in the context of long-term studies of vertebrates. The available evidence points to the overall conclusion that many responses perceived as adaptations to changing environmental conditions could be environmentally induced plastic responses rather than microevolutionary adaptations. Hence, clear-cut evidence indicating a significant role for evolutionary adaptation to ongoing climate warming is conspicuously scarce.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gienapp","given":"P."},{"family":"Teplitsky","given":"C."},{"family":"Alho","given":"J.

Further, defining senders and receivers in vocal communication can be difficult even in simple vocal exchanges, which is even more challenging when a group of individuals is vocalising close by. But especially in group-living animals, vocal communication often plays a crucial role for survival and reproduction: vocal signals are used to facilitate contact and coordination with an entire group, for example to optimise foraging and anti-predator behaviour, but also to find and communicate with important members inside the group, for example with offspring or a mate. Songbirds may use two different types of signals to communicate vocally: songs and calls. Songs are intricate, learned vocal patterns, often involved in mate attraction and territory defence. Calls are simpler in structure, but more variable in terms of the contexts in which they occur, making them more flexible for the use in communicative vocal interactions between individuals – but also making them difficult to study.<br />To investigate group vocal communication from a functional perspective, it would be ideal to disentangle the roles, costs and benefits of all individuals involved in vocal interactions, while providing complex contexts in which animals may exhibit their normal behaviours. One approach to this is to place a microphone directly on the sound-producing animal, which opens up the possibility to study different, even very “private”, communication channels of individuals inside groups. Due to technical advances (miniaturisation), this approach is becoming increasingly available, even for small animals, but so far, studies are rare that investigate such techniques, their potential effects, pros and cons, to make use of their full potential. The main aim of this dissertation was thus to investigate different methods for studying vocal communication of group-living songbirds in naturalistic contexts, in order to answer specific research questions.<br />I studied the effects of such methods on small songbirds under controlled conditions, and investigated their potential for communication studies (chapter 1). I also got involved in establishing a basis for acoustic context recognition and information yield of on-board microphone recordings (chapter 3), and used alternative approaches to define senders and receivers of vocal interactions (chapter 2, Appendix 1). Applying these methods, I was able to disentangle “who is who” in natural, i.e. spontaneously occurring, vocal interactions in group-housed zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in the lab, and in wild, group-living jackdaws (Corvus monedula) in the field. In this way, I studied the importance of zebra finch call communication of individuals and pairs inside groups over the course of changing life-history stages (chapter 2), and found that call types not only changed in terms of individual-level usage, but also in vocal interactions between individuals. I also found evidence that calling interactions between mates may be related to pair breeding success, thus highlighting the importance of calls in communication systems. In jackdaws, by revealing male copulation calls and extra-pair copulation behaviour (chapter 4), I was able to describe unknown aspects of vocal behaviour as a basis for future investigations, and challenge previous claims of absolute monogamy in this corvid species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gill","given":"Lisa Franziska"}],"citation-key":"gillStudyingIndividualVocal2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"eng","license":"terms-of-use","note":"Accepted: 2017-01-18T13:56:17Z","source":"kops.uni-konstanz.de","title":"Studying individual vocal communication in group-living songbirds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/36811"},{"id":"giretConspecificDiscriminationObjectchoice2009","abstract":"Living in social groups presents the opportunity to use information provided by other individuals.

Suppose that memory and conceptualization work in the service of perception and action. In this case, conceptualization is the encoding of patterns of possible physical interaction with a three-dimensional world. These patterns are constrained by the structure of the environment, the structure of our bodies, and memory. Thus, how we perceive and conceive of the environment is determined by the types of bodies we have. Such a memory would not have associations. Instead, how concepts become related (and what it means to be related) is determined by how separate patterns of actions can be combined given the constraints of our bodies. I call this combination “mesh.” To avoid hallucination, conceptualization would normally be driven by the environment, and patterns of action from memory would play a supporting, but automatic, role. A significant human skill is learning to suppress the overriding contribution of the environment to conceptualization, thereby allowing memory to guide conceptualization. The effort used in suppressing input from the environment pays off by allowing prediction, recollective memory, and language comprehension. I review theoretical work in cognitive science and empirical work in memory and language comprehension that suggest that it may be possible to investigate connections between topics as disparate as infantile amnesia and mental-model theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Glenberg","given":"Arthur M."}],"citation-key":"glenbergWhatMemoryCreating1997","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","container-title-short":"Behav Brain Sci","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X97470012","ISSN":"0140-525X, 1469-1825","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",3]]},"language":"en","page":"41-50","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What memory is for: Creating meaning in the service of action","title-short":"What memory is for","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0140525X97470012/type/journal_article","volume":"20"},{"id":"gonzalezEvolutionaryRescueEmerging2013","abstract":"There is concern that the rate of environmental change is now exceeding the capacity of many populations to adapt. Mitigation of biodiversity loss requires science that integrates both ecological and evolutionary responses of populations and communities to rapid environmental change, and can identify the conditions that allow the recovery of declining populations.

ER emphasizes a shift to a perspective on evolutionary dynamics that focuses on short time-scales, genetic variants of large effects and absolute rather than relative fitness. The contributions in this issue reflect the state of field; the articles address the latest conceptual developments, and report novel theoretical and experimental results. The examples in this issue demonstrate that this burgeoning area of research can inform problems of direct practical concern, such as the conservation of biodiversity, adaptation to climate change and the emergence of infectious disease. The continued development of research on ER will be necessary if we are to understand the extent to which anthropogenic global change will reduce the Earth's biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Ronce","given":"Ophélie"},{"family":"Ferriere","given":"Regis"},{"family":"Hochberg","given":"Michael E."}],"citation-key":"gonzalezEvolutionaryRescueEmerging2013","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2012.0404","issue":"1610","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,19]]},"page":"20120404","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Evolutionary rescue: an emerging focus at the intersection between ecology and evolution","title-short":"Evolutionary rescue","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2012.0404","volume":"368"},{"id":"goodmanAvianBodySize2012","abstract":"There has been a growing interest in whether established ecogeographical patterns, such as Bergmann’s rule, explain changes in animal morphology related to climate change. Bergmann’s rule has often been used to predict that body size will decrease as the climate warms, but the predictions about how body size will change are critically dependent on the mechanistic explanation behind the rule. To investigate change in avian body size in western North America, we used two long-term banding data sets from central California, USA; the data spanned 40 years (1971–2010) at one site and 27 years (1983–2009) at the other. We found that wing length of birds captured at both sites has been steadily increasing at a rate of 0.024–0.084% per year. Although changes in body mass were not always signiﬁcant, when they were, the trend was positive and the magnitudes of signiﬁcant trends were similar to those for wing length (0.040–0.112% per year). There was no clear difference between the rates of change of long-distance vs. short-distance migrants or between birds that bred locally compared to those that bred to the north of the sites. Previous studies from other regions of the world have documented decreases in avian body size and have used Bergmann’s rule and increases in mean temperature to explain these shifts. Because our results do not support this pattern, we propose that rather than responding to increasing mean temperatures, avian body size in central California may be inﬂuenced by changing climatic variability or changes in primary productivity. More information on regional variation in the rates of avian body size change will be needed to test these hypotheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Goodman","given":"Rae E."},{"family":"Lebuhn","given":"Gretchen"},{"family":"Seavy","given":"Nathaniel E."},{"family":"Gardali","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Bluso‐Demers","given":"Jill D."}],"citation-key":"goodmanAvianBodySize2012","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02538.x","ISSN":"1354-1013, 1365-2486","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","page":"63-73","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Avian body size changes and climate change: warming or increasing variability?","title-short":"Avian body size changes and climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02538.x","volume":"18"},{"id":"goodmanDirtyDozenTwelve2008","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Goodman","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"goodmanDirtyDozenTwelve2008","container-title":"Seminars in Hematology","container-title-short":"Seminars in Hematology","DOI":"10.1053/j.seminhematol.2008.04.003","ISSN":"00371963","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"135-140","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Dirty Dozen: Twelve P-Value Misconceptions","title-short":"A Dirty Dozen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0037196308000620","volume":"45"},{"id":"goossensExtrapairPaternityMonogamous1998","abstract":"The genetic parentage and pedigrees of 35 litters from 12 family groups of monogamous Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) in the French Alps were analyzed using six hypervariable sequence repeat nuclear loci (microsatellites).

Eight locations were sampled in the French Alps, one from Les Ecrins valley (n = 160), another from La Sassière valley (n = 289) and the six others from the Maurienne valley (n = 139). Information on social group structure was available for both Les Ecrins and La Sassière but not for the other samples. The high levels of genetic diversity observed are at odds with the results obtained using microsatellites, minisatellites and allozymes on Alpine marmots from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Strong deficits in heterozygotes were found in Les Ecrins and La Sassière. They are caused by a Wahlund effect due to the family structure (i.e. differentiation between the family groups). The family groups exhibit excess of heterozygotes rather than deficits. This may be caused by outbreeding and this is compatible with recent results from the genetics of related social species when information on the social structure is taken into account. The observed outbreeding could be the result of females mating with transient males or males coming from neighbouring colonies. Both indicate that the species may not be as monogamous as is usually believed. The results are also compatible with a male-biased dispersal but do not allow us to exclude some female migration. We also found a significant correlation between geographical and genetic distance indicating that isolation by distance could be an issue in marmots. This study is the first that analysed populations of marmots taking into account the social structure within populations and assessing inbreeding at different levels (region, valley, population, and family groups). Our study clearly demonstrated that the sampling strategy and behavioural information can have dramatic effects on both the results and interpretation of the genetic data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Goossens","given":"B."},{"family":"Chikhi","given":"L."},{"family":"Taberlet","given":"P."},{"family":"Waits","given":"L.

Categorical perception was first described in the context of speech and thought to be uniquely associated with human language. Subsequent work has since discovered that categorical perception functions in communication and decision-making across animal taxa, behavioral contexts, and sensory modalities. We begin with an overview of how categorical perception functions in speech perception and, then, describe subsequent work illustrating its role in nonhuman animal communication and decision-making. We synthesize this work to suggest that categorical perception may be favored where there is a benefit to 1) setting consistent behavioral response rules in the face of variation and potential overlap in the physical structure of signals, 2) especially rapid decision-making, or 3) reducing the costs associated with processing and/or comparing signals.

Most environmental perturbations of development are likely to reduce fitness, and thus selection would usually be expected to favor genetic changes that restore the ancestral phenotype. I propose the term “genetic compensation” to refer to this form of adaptive evolution. Genetic compensation is a subset of genetic accommodation and the reverse of genetic assimilation. When genetic compensation has occurred along a spatial environmental gradient, the mean trait values of populations in different environments may be more similar in the field than when representatives of the same populations are raised in a common environment (i.e., countergradient variation). If compensation is complete, genetic divergence between populations may be cryptic, that is, not detectable in the field. Here I apply the concept of genetic compensation to three examples involving carotenoid‐based sexual coloration and then use these and other examples to discuss the concept in a broader context. I show that genetic compensation may lead to a cryptic form of reproductive isolation between populations evolving in different environments, may explain some puzzling cases in which heritable traits exposed to strong directional selection fail to show the expected evolutionary response, and may complicate efforts to monitor populations for signs of environmental deterioration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Grether","given":"Gregory F."}],"citation-key":"gretherEnvironmentalChangePhenotypic2005","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/432023","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10]]},"page":"E115-E123","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Environmental Change, Phenotypic Plasticity, and Genetic Compensation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/432023","volume":"166"},{"id":"gretherRoleInterspecificInterference2009","abstract":"The extent to which interspecific interference competition has contributed to character evolution is one of the most neglected problems in evolutionary biology. When formerly allopatric species come into secondary contact, aggressive interactions between the species can cause selection on traits that affect interspecific encounter rates (e.g. habitat preferences, activity schedules), competitor recognition (e.g. colouration, song), and fighting ability (e.g. weaponry, body size). We define agonistic character displacement (ACD) as the process of phenotypic evolution in a population caused by interference competition with one or more sympatric species and which results in shifts in traits that affect the rate, intensity or outcome of interspecific aggression. After clarifying the relationships between ACD and other evolutionary processes that may occur when species come into secondary contact, we develop an individual-based, quantitative genetic model to examine how traits involved in competitor recognition would be expected to evolve under different secondary contact scenarios. Our simulation results show that both divergence and convergence are possible outcomes, depending on the intensity of interspecific exploitative competition, the costs associated with mutual versus unilateral recognition, and the extent of phenotypic differences prior to secondary contact. We then devise a set of eight criteria for evaluating putative examples of ACD and review the empirical literature to assess the strength of existing evidence and to identify promising avenues for future research. Our literature search revealed 33 putative examples of ACD across insects, fishes, bats, birds, lizards, and amphibians (15 divergence examples; 18 convergence examples). Only one example satisfies all eight criteria for demonstrating ACD, but most case studies satisfy four or more criteria. The current state of the evidence for ACD is similar to the state of the evidence for ecological character displacement just 10 years ago.

Many of their behavior patterns suggest that animals have mental images of objects, events, or relationships remote from the immediate stimulus situation, as well as self-awareness and intentions concerning future actions. Our behavioristic Zeitgeist has inhibited investigation of such possibilities, but reopening these long-neglected questions requires no departure from the materialistic approach to biological and behavioral science. The basic question at issue involves a comparison of those aspects of human and nonhuman brain function that sometimes lead to what we call mental experiences, at least in our own species. It seems more feasible to devise objectively verifiable tests for the existence of these general categories of mental experiences than for that of many others. While many other kinds of evidence could well be used (with appropriate caution and all possible controls) to weigh the likelihood that animals sometimes know what they are doing, the experimental use of communicative behavior seems especially promising, because the latter could serve a function analogous to human language, which provides our best evidence about the mental experiences of our fellow men.","author":[{"family":"Griffin","given":"Donald R"}],"citation-key":"griffinProspectsCognitiveEthology","language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Prospects for a cognitive ethology","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"grossPsychologyScienceMind2012","abstract":"500,000 students later Gross continues to set the standard for Psychology textbooks.

The prevalence of lateralization makes it likely that it has some major advantage. Until now, however, conclusive evidence has been lacking. To analyze the relation between the extent of cerebral asymmetry and the degree of performance in visual foraging, we studied grain–grit discrimination success in pigeons, a species with a left hemisphere dominance for visual object processing 2, 3. The birds performed the task under left-eye, right-eye or binocular seeing conditions. In most animals, right-eye seeing was superior to left-eye seeing performance, and binocular performance was higher than each monocular level. The absolute difference between left- and right-eye levels was defined as a measure for the degree of visual asymmetry. Animals with higher asymmetries were more successful in discriminating grain from grit under binocular conditions. This shows that an increase in visual asymmetry enhances success in visually guided foraging. Possibly, asymmetries of the pigeon’s visual system increase the computational speed of object recognition processes by concentrating them into one hemisphere while preventing the other side of the brain from initiating conflicting search sequences of its own.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Güntürkün","given":"Onur"},{"family":"Diekamp","given":"Bettina"},{"family":"Manns","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Nottelmann","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Prior","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Ariane"},{"family":"Skiba","given":"Martina"}],"citation-key":"gunturkunAsymmetryPaysVisual2000","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00671-0","ISSN":"0960-9822","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1079-1081","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Asymmetry pays: visual lateralization improves discrimination success in pigeons","title-short":"Asymmetry pays","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982200006710","volume":"10"},{"id":"gunturkunDOI101007S0042601103779","abstract":"Abstract This review describes a case of convergence in the evolution of brain and cognition. Both mammals and birds can organize their behavior flexibly over time and evolved similar cognitive skills. The avian forebrain displays no lamination that corresponds to the mammalian neocortex; hence, lamination does not seem to be a requirement for higher cognitive functions. In mammals, executive functions are associated with the prefrontal cortex. The corresponding structure in birds is the nidopallium caudolaterale. Anatomic, neurochemical, electrophysiologic and behavioral studies show these structures to be highly similar, but not homologous. Thus, despite the presence (mammals) or the absence (birds) of a laminated forebrain, ‘prefrontal ’ areas in mammals and birds converged over evolutionary time into a highly similar neural architecture. The neuroarchitectonic degrees of freedom to create different neural architectures that generate identical prefrontal functions seem to be very limited.

In each social group, only dominant females produced weaned young although subordinate females had similar body condition, were fertile as indicated by high levels of oestradiol during the mating season, and occasionally started pregnancies. During the period of gestation, dominant females initiated significantly more agonistic interactions against subordinate females, resulting in significantly increased levels of glucocorticoids and decreased levels of progesterone in subordinates. Results suggested that reproductive suppression in female Alpine marmots is mediated by the negative effects of stress (glucocorticoids) on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The strength of competition between subordinate and dominant females was affected by their relatedness. Dominant females attacked unrelated subordinate females more, whereas amicable behaviour was observed mainly between dominant females and their daughters. These differences could be explained by differences in indirect fitness: related subordinate females benefited from warming the offspring of the dominant female during hibernation. Reproductive suppression was apparently costly for dominant females, because their reproductive success decreased as the number of adult subordinate females in a group increased.

Empirical studies of cryptic evolution have usually invoked a changing climate and/or increasing population density as the form of detrimental environmental change experienced by a population undergoing cryptic evolution. However, Fisher (1958) emphasized that evolutionary change in itself is likely to be an important component of “environmental deterioration,” a point restated by Cooke\net al. (1990) in the context of intraspecific competition. In this form, environmental deterioration arises because a winning lineage has to compete against more winners in successive generations as the population evolves. This “evolutionary environmental deterioration” has different implications for the selection and evolution of traits influenced by resource competition than general environmental change. We reformulate Cooke's model as a quantitative genetic model to show that it is identical in form to more recent developments proposed by quantitative geneticists. This provides a statistical framework for discriminating between the alternative hypotheses of environmental change and environmental deterioration caused by evolutionary change. We also demonstrate that in systems where no phenotypic change has occurred, there are many reasonable biological processes that will generate patterns in predicted breeding values that are consistent with what has been interpreted as cryptic evolution, and care needs to be taken when interpreting these patterns. These processes include mutation, sib competition, and invisible fractions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hadfield","given":"Jarrod D."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Alastair J."},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E.

Over the past decade it has been used extensively in ecology and evolutionary biology to predict individual breeding values and reaction norms. These predictions have been used to infer natural selection, evolutionary change, spatial‐genetic patterns, individual reaction norms, and frailties. In this article we show analytically and through simulation and example why BLUP often gives anticonservative and biased estimates of evolutionary and ecological parameters. Although some concerns with BLUP methodology have been voiced before, the scale and breadth of the problems have probably not been widely appreciated. Bias arises because BLUPs are often used to estimate effects that are not explicitly accounted for in the model used to make the predictions. In these cases, predicted breeding values will often say more about phenotypic patterns than the genetic patterns of interest. An additional problem is that BLUPs are point estimates of quantities that are usually known with little certainty. Failure to account for this uncertainty in subsequent tests can lead to both bias and extreme anticonservatism. We demonstrate that restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian solutions exist for these problems and show how unbiased and powerful tests can be derived that adequately quantify uncertainty. Of particular utility is a new test for detecting evolutionary change that not only accounts for prediction error in breeding values but also accounts for drift. To illustrate the problem, we apply these tests to long‐term data on the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and the great tit (Parus major) and show that previously reported temporal trends in breeding values are not supported.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hadfield","given":"Jarrod D."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Alastair J."},{"family":"Garant","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Sheldon","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E. B."}],"citation-key":"hadfieldMisuseBLUPEcology2010","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/648604","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1]]},"page":"116-125","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"The Misuse of BLUP in Ecology and Evolution.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/648604","volume":"175"},{"id":"hahnDiscriminationAcousticallySimilar2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hahn","given":"Allison H."},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Kimberley A."},{"family":"Congdon","given":"Jenna V."},{"family":"Hoang","given":"John"},{"family":"McMillan","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Scully","given":"Erin N."},{"family":"Yong","given":"Joshua J.

We survey the literature on agonistic behavior in mice from 1976 through 1994 and describe interesting uses of those three methods. One of those methods (the standard tester design) often employs a “noninteractive” social partner. We present data showing that the standard tester design may be more valuable when using an evocative and interactive standard tester.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hahn","given":"Martin E."},{"family":"Schanz","given":"Norman"}],"citation-key":"hahnIssuesGeneticsSocial1996","container-title":"Behavior Genetics","container-title-short":"Behav Genet","DOI":"10.1007/BF02359750","ISSN":"1573-3297","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"463-470","source":"Springer Link","title":"Issues in the genetics of social behavior: Revisited","title-short":"Issues in the genetics of social behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02359750","volume":"26"},{"id":"hajdukAlgebraEvolutionRobertson2020","abstract":"By the Robertson–Price identity, the change in a quantitative trait owing to selection, is equal to the trait's covariance with relative fitness. In this study, we applied the identity to long-term data on superb fairy-wrens\n              Malurus cyaneus\n              , to estimate phenotypic and genetic change owing to juvenile viability selection. Mortality in the four-week period between fledging and independence was 40%, and heavier nestlings were more likely to survive, but why? There was additive genetic variance for both nestling mass and survival, and a positive phenotypic covariance between the traits, but no evidence of additive genetic covariance. Comparing standardized gradients, the phenotypic selection gradient was positive,\n              β\n              P\n              = 0.108 (0.036, 0.187 95% CI), whereas the genetic gradient was not different from zero,\n              β\n              A\n              = −0.025 (−0.19, 0.107 95% CI).

It is possible that in noisy, high-disturbance environments, the range and severity of impacts could diminish over time, but the influence of previous disturbance remains untested in natural conditions. This study demonstrates the effects of motorboat noise on the physiology of an endemic cichlid fish in Lake Malawi. Exposure to motorboats (driven 20–100 m from fish) and loudspeaker playback of motorboat noise both elevated the oxygen-consumption rate at a single lower-disturbance site, characterized by low historic and current motorboat activity. Repeating this assay at further lower-disturbance sites revealed a consistent effect of elevated oxygen consumption in response to motorboat disturbance. However, when similar trials were repeated at four higher-disturbance sites, no effect of motorboat exposure was detected. These results demonstrate that disturbance history can affect local population responses to noise. Action regarding noise pollution should consider the past, as well as the present, when planning for the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Harding","given":"Harry R."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Timothy A.

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding.

It is evident, nevertheless, that birds preferentially use either their left or right eye for viewing novel or familiar stimuli [1], and perform visual discrimination tasks under monocular viewing conditions better with one eye than with the other 2, 3. Because of the nearly complete contralateral decussation of the optic nerves in birds [4], it has been assumed that this division of labour is due solely to cerebral hemispheric specialisation, generated as a result of uneven photostimulation of the eyes of the developing embryo during the last three or four days before hatching 5, 6. Here, however, we present evidence that in the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, even the retinae are morphologically asymmetrical in terms of photoreceptor distribution. This is the first evidence for such asymmetry in any bird and suggests that retinal photoreceptor composition should be assessed during studies involving the lateralisation of visually mediated behaviours.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hart","given":"N.

We explored here the occurrence of geographical body size clines using measurements of average body sizes of 10 species collected in pelagic trawl hauls carried out during acoustic surveys in the Mediterranean Sea. Bergmann’s rule was evaluated by correlating body sizes with latitude and temperature for each species while accounting for potential confounding variables and sampling bias. For 5 species, namely anchovy, sardine, Atlantic chub mackerel, bogue, and blue jack mackerel, we demonstrate that they follow a Bergmann’s rule, with a decline in average body size by about 3.01, 3.43, 3.67, 3.82, and 3.76 % per 1°C of warming respectively, although this did not translate with an increase in size with latitude. The adherence of these 5 pelagic fish to Bergmann’s rules strongly suggests that temperature is a major determinant of their body sizes and enables them to act as sentinel species for identifying the drivers and consequences of warming in the Mediterranean ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hattab","given":"Tarek"},{"family":"Gucu","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Ventero","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Felice","given":"Andrea","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Machias","given":"Athanassios"},{"family":"Saraux","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Gašparević","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Basilone","given":"Gualtiero"},{"family":"Costantini","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Leonori","given":"Iole"},{"family":"Bourdeix","given":"Jean-Hervé"},{"family":"Iglesias","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Barra","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Giannoulaki","given":"Marianna"},{"family":"Ferreri","given":"Rosalia"},{"family":"El Ayoubi","given":"Salah"},{"family":"Malavolti","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Genovese","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Somarakis","given":"Stelios"},{"family":"Juretić","given":"Tea"},{"family":"Tičina","given":"Vjekoslav"},{"family":"Certain","given":"Grégoire"}],"citation-key":"hattabTemperatureStronglyCorrelates2021","container-title":"Mediterranean Marine Science","DOI":"10.12681/mms.26525","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"page":"800","publisher":"Athens : National Centre for Marine Research","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Temperature strongly correlates with regional patterns of body size variation in Mediterranean small pelagic fish species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.science/hal-03607874","volume":"22"},{"id":"hausbergerCallingRhythmPredictor2020","abstract":"Vocal communication plays an important role in the regulation of social interactions and the coordination of activities in many animal species.

Behavioural measures in &ldquo;(food) distracted&rdquo; captive Campbell&rsquo;s monkeys and electrophysiological recordings in anesthetised (versus awake) European starlings were performed during the broadcast of auditory stimuli with different functional &ldquo;saliences&rdquo; (e.g., familiar/novel). In Campbell&rsquo;s monkeys, only novel sounds elicited lateralised responses, with a right hemisphere preference. Unfamiliar sounds elicited more head movements, reflecting enhanced attention, whereas familiar (usual in the home environment) sounds elicited few responses, and thus might not be arousing enough to stimulate attention. In starlings, in field L, when awake, individual identity was processed more in the right hemisphere, whereas, when anaesthetised, the left hemisphere was more involved in processing potentially socially meaningless sounds. These results suggest that the attention-getting property of stimuli may be an adapted concept for explaining hemispheric auditory specialisation. An attention-based model may reconcile the different existing hypotheses of a Right Hemisphere-arousal/intensity or individual based lateralisation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"},{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Meter","given":"Anaïke"},{"family":"Karino","given":"Genta"},{"family":"George","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Lemasson","given":"Alban"},{"family":"Blois-Heulin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"hausbergerCrucialRoleAttention2019","container-title":"Symmetry","DOI":"10.3390/sym11010048","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","page":"48","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Crucial Role of Attention in Lateralisation of Sound Processing?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/1/48","volume":"11"},{"id":"hausbergerDialectUseLarge2008","abstract":"Dialects may signal social or population identity and increase tolerance within communities.

However, many studies using such comparisons have been performed in captive environments. These environments may produce unnaturally high antagonistic interactions, exaggerating the stress of social subordination and any associated adverse consequences. One such adverse effect concerns impaired cognitive ability, often thought to be associated with social subordination. Here, we tested whether social dominance rank is associated with differences in spatial learning and memory, and in reversal spatial learning (flexibility) abilities in wild food-caching mountain chickadees at different montane elevations. Higher dominance rank was associated with higher spatial cognitive flexibility in harsh environments at higher elevations, but not at lower, milder elevations. By contrast, there were no consistent differences in spatial learning and memory ability associated with dominance rank. Our results suggest that spatial learning and memory ability in specialized food-caching species is a stable trait resilient to social influences. Spatial cognitive flexibility, on the other hand, appears to be more sensitive to environmental influences, including social dominance. These findings contradict those from laboratory studies and suggest that it is critical to investigate the biological consequences of social dominance under natural conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Heinen","given":"Virginia K."},{"family":"Benedict","given":"Lauren M."},{"family":"Pitera","given":"Angela M."},{"family":"Sonnenberg","given":"Benjamin R."},{"family":"Bridge","given":"Eli S."},{"family":"Pravosudov","given":"Vladimir V."}],"citation-key":"heinenSocialDominanceHas2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

Many of the papers present evidence of microevolution occuring over contemporary time frames, further validating the near ubiquity of ongoing evolution in the world around us. Several synthetic reviews of empirical work help to define the conditions under which microevolution is or is not likely to occur. Some of the studies speak directly to current controversies in evolutionary biology, such as the relative roles of determinism and contigency, and the nature of the relationship between microevolution and macroevolution. In general, microevolution seems driven largely by deterministic mechanisms, particularly natural selection, but contingency plays a role in (1) determining whether or not suitable conditions are present for evolution to proceed, and (2) guiding the precise manner by which evolution proceeds. Several theoretical treatments and empirical reviews confirm previous research in showing that microevolutionary processes are at least capable of generating macroevolutionary trends. Macroevolution may indeed reflect microevolution writ large but the pattern by which it arises is perhaps best charcaterized as microevolution writ in fits and starts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hendry","given":"A.P."},{"family":"Kinnison","given":"M.T."}],"citation-key":"hendryIntroductionMicroevolutionRate2001","container-title":"Genetica","container-title-short":"Genetica","DOI":"10.1023/A:1013368628607","ISSN":"1573-6857","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","source":"Springer Link","title":"An introduction to microevolution: rate, pattern, process","title-short":"An introduction to microevolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1013368628607","volume":"112"},{"id":"hendryPerspectivePaceModern1999","abstract":"We evaluate methods for measuring and specifying rates of microevolution in the wild, with particular regard to studies of contemporary, often deemed “rapid,” evolution. A considerable amount of ambiguity and inconsistency persists within the field, and we provide a number of suggestions that should improve study design, inference, and clarity of presentation. (1) Some studies measure change over time within a population (allochronic) and others measure the difference between two populations that had a common ancestor in the past (synchronic). Allochronic studies can be used to estimate rates of “evolution,” whereas synchronic studies more appropriately estimate rates of “divergence.” Rates of divergence may range from a small fraction to many times the actual evolutionary rates in the component populations. (2) Some studies measure change using individuals captured from the wild, whereas others measure differences after rearing in a common environment. The first type of study can be used to specify “phenotypic” rates and the later “genetic” rates. (3) The most commonly used evolutionary rate metric, the darwin, has a number of theoretical shortcomings. Studies of microevolution would benefit from specifying rates in standard deviations per generation, the haldane. (4) Evolutionary rates are typically specified without an indication of their precision. Readily available methods for specifying confidence intervals and statistical significance (regression, bootstrapping, randomization) should be implemented. (5) Microevolutionists should strive to accumulate time series, which can reveal temporal shifts in the rate of evolution and can be used to identify evolutionary patterns. (6) Evolutionary rates provide a convenient way to compare the tempo of evolution across studies, traits, taxa, and time scales, but such comparisons are subject to varying degrees of confidence. Comparisons across different time scales are particularly tenuous. (7) A number of multivariate rate measures exist, but considerable theoretical development is required before their utility can be determined. We encourage the continued investigation of evolutionary rates because the information they provide is relevant to a wide range of theoretical and practical issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hendry","given":"Andrew P."},{"family":"Kinnison","given":"Michael T."}],"citation-key":"hendryPerspectivePaceModern1999","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb04550.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","page":"1637-1653","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Perspective: The Pace of Modern Life: Measuring Rates of Contemporary Microevolution","title-short":"Perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb04550.x","volume":"53"},{"id":"henryDialectsAnimalsEvidence2015","abstract":"Dialects are one of the parallels that have long been established between human language and animal communication.

We studied the vocal and social behavior of captive male and female European starlings during two periods: breeding and non-breeding periods. Our results indicated that females sang mostly in a non-breeding context: their singing behavior was strongly diminished when nestboxes were present in the aviary. Moreover, females sang more frequently when their closest neighbor was a female whereas males sang mostly when they had no immediate neighbor.

We investigated here whether a mirror may have such a ‘quietening effect’ on birds kept in a laboratory, such as European starlings. We observed the reactions to a mirror of starlings of different sexes and with different social experiences. Females and pair-raised males seemed calmer, showing less movement and more comfort behaviour than socially and single-raised birds. The results are discussed in the light of the species' social organization and the effect of social experience.

Comparisons of both genetic variances and selection gradients across traits or populations require standardization, as both are scale dependent. The Lande equation can be standardized in two ways. Standardizing by the variance of the selected trait yields the response in units of standard deviation as the product of the heritability and the variance-standardized selection gradient. This standardization conflates selection and variation because the phenotypic variance is a function of the genetic variance. Alternatively, one can standardize the Lande equation using the trait mean, yielding the proportional response to selection as the product of the squared coefficient of additive genetic variance and the mean-standardized selection gradient. Mean-standardized selection gradients are particularly useful for summarizing the strength of selection because the mean-standardized gradient for fitness itself is one, a convenient benchmark for strong selection. We review published estimates of directional selection in natural populations using mean-standardized selection gradients. Only 38 published studies provided all the necessary information for calculation of mean-standardized gradients. The median absolute value of multivariate mean-standardized gradients shows that selection is on average 54% as strong as selection on fitness. Correcting for the upward bias introduced by taking absolute values lowers the median to 31%, still very strong selection. Such large estimates clearly cannot be representative of selection on all traits. Some possible sources of overestimation of the strength of selection include confounding environmental and genotypic effects on fitness, the use of fitness components as proxies for fitness, and biases in publication or choice of traits to study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hereford","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Thomas F."},{"family":"Houle","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"herefordComparingStrengthsDirectional2004","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01592.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"2133-2143","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Comparing Strengths of Directional Selection: How Strong Is Strong?","title-short":"Comparing Strengths of Directional Selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01592.x","volume":"58"},{"id":"herrnsteinAcquisitionGeneralizationDiscrimination1979","author":[{"family":"Herrnstein","given":"R J"}],"citation-key":"herrnsteinAcquisitionGeneralizationDiscrimination1979","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]},"language":"en","page":"14","source":"Zotero","title":"Acquisition, Generalization, and Discrimination Reversal of a Natural Concept","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"herrnsteinComplexVisualConcept1964","author":[{"family":"Herrnstein","given":"R J"},{"family":"Loveland","given":"Donald H"}],"citation-key":"herrnsteinComplexVisualConcept1964","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.146.3643.549","issue":"3643","issued":{"date-parts":[["1964"]]},"page":"549-551","title":"Complex visual concept in the pigeon","type":"article-journal","volume":"146"},{"id":"herrnsteinFishNaturalCategory1980","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Herrnstein","given":"R.J."},{"family":"Villiers","given":"Peter A.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"herrnsteinFishNaturalCategory1980","container-title":"Psychology of Learning and Motivation","DOI":"10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60159-0","ISBN":"978-0-12-543314-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]},"language":"en","page":"59-95","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fish as a Natural Category for People and Pigeons","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079742108601590","volume":"14"},{"id":"herrnsteinLawEffect11970","abstract":"Experiments on single, multiple, and concurrent schedules of reinforcement find various correlations between the rate of responding and the rate or magnitude of reinforcement.

In contrast, with other contingencies of reinforcement, pigeons will not extract abstract rules of categorization; they will instead learn to identify visual stimuli down to small details, and they will retain much of what they learned for a year and more.

Here we used the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) as an indicator of the complex links between largescale environmental variables that influence both marine and tundra trophic dynamics to demonstrate how they affect the fox's body size and abundance. The Arctic fox inhabits throughout Iceland, where it preys mainly on birds. We studied the effects of the Sub-Polar Gyre (SPG), winter and summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), mean annual winter and summer temperature, and geographic sector (eastern and western Iceland, which differ in their ecology) on variations in mandible size (6345 specimens) and body mass (2732 specimens) as well as abundance on the Arctic fox in Iceland. We found that (a) SPG index negatively affected male mandible length as well as body mass of both sexes. SPG was also negatively related to fox abundance. (b) Summer NAO had a negative effect on Arctic foxes, that is, cold summers were correlated with shorter mandibles and lower body mass. (c) Winter NAO had a significant negative effect (although weaker than that of summer NAO) on female mandible length, but not on body mass. (d) Summer temperature had a positive effect on female mandible length, but no effect on body mass. However, winter temperature had no effect on either the mandible or body mass. (e) Foxes in the eastern sector had shorter mandibles and were of lighter mass than those in the western sector. We suggest that climate conditions during the growth period of the young affected their final size both directly, by influencing energy metabolism for maintenance, but mainly through their effects on food availability.

We evaluate the evidence from empirical studies of genetic variance components and find that additive variance typically accounts for over half, and often close to 100%, of the total genetic variance. We present new theoretical results, based upon the distribution of allele frequencies under neutral and other population genetic models, that show why this is the case even if there are non-additive effects at the level of gene action.

Although infected females maintained under various laboratory conditions never produce uninfected offspring, some wild-caught infected females produce both infected and uninfected progeny. This helps explain the persistence of a low frequency of uninfected flies in predominantly infected populations and may also explain the other polymorphisms observed.

Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances.

Successful curing of affected lines with antibiotics demonstrated this trait was associated with the presence of a bacterium, and molecular systematic analysis demonstrated an association between the presence of the trait and infection with an A group Wolbachia. The penetrance and heritability of the trait did not vary with maternal age. Exposure to elevated temperatures did reduce trait penetrance but did not affect heritability. Examination of the effect of temperature on bacterial density in eggs revealed a decrease in bacterial density following exposure of the parent to elevated temperature, consistent with the hypothesis that male killing in D. bifasciata requires a threshold density of Wolbachia within eggs. The male offspring produced following exposure to elevated temperatures were infected with Wolbachia on emergence as adults. Crossing studies demonstrated a weak cytoplasmic incompatibility phenotype exhibited by Wolbachia in these males.

The aim of the present series of experiments was to investigate whether such stimuli had potential for use as bird scarers. The starling (Sturnus vulgaris) was the subject species. The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area. Each subject was deprived of food for 5 h and then tested in an apparatus which exposed an eye pattern over a food trough immediately after the bird alighted on that trough. 10 measures of the starlings' feeding behaviour were monitored over a 1-h trial. It was predicted that five of these variables would be positively and five negatively correlated with an increase in the fear evoking properties of the stimulus. The 10 measures were analysed using principal component analysis and the first component in every experiment had the signs of the latent vectors of the variables exactly in the predicted pattern and therefore appeared to be an ‘aversiveness index’. The scores from this first component were then used in a Latin square ANOVA to distinguish subject, test order and stimulus effects. The main findings from the eight experiments are as follows. Simple eye-like patterns can indeed deter hungry starlings from feeding in their vicinity. The presence of a pair of eyes painted on a white card caused an 88% reduction in time spent on the nearby food trough and a 65% reduction in actual feeding time. The presence of ‘pupils’ in the patterns is essential for simple circles alone are not significantly more aversive than the control card. Once a pattern has the ‘pupil/iris’ distinction then a circular outline becomes important although the shape of the ‘pupil’ appears relatively unimportant. Eyes with coloured irises are more effective than black and white patterns but the degree of contrast between the ‘pupil’ and ‘iris’ appears irrelevant. Increasing the number of simultaneously presented eyes from one to three is correlated with an increasing trend in aversiveness which is destroyed if the same stimuli are presented within the context of a simple head outline. Changing the orientation of a pair of eyes from horizontal to vertical only slightly reduces their aversiveness. The size of the patterns appears to be unimportant within the range tested. The aversive properties of eyespots and of broadcast starling distress calls are positively additive. The effectiveness of a stimulus combining all the important features mentioned is as aversive as is a realistic model of the head of an owl.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Inglis","given":"I.

This suggests that selection may act on cognitive performance through mate choice. Studies investigating this relationship have tended to focus on single cognitive tasks, or tasks that are closely related to existing natural behaviours, and individuals are frequently tested in captive conditions. This can introduce test artefacts and may tell us more about selection on specific display behaviours that we imagine being particularly cognitively complex, rather than a general cognitive ability. We tested free-living male spotted bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus maculatus, that exhibit elaborate sexual displays which appear to be cognitively demanding. We describe a method for testing individuals in the wild, without the need for constraint or captivity. We looked for evidence of a general cognitive ability in males by assaying their performance in a series of novel tasks reflecting their natural bower-building behaviour (bower maintenance) or capturing more abstract measures of cognitive ability (colour and shape discrimination, reversal learning, spatial memory and motor skills). We related performance in these tasks to their mating success. An individual's performance in one task was a relatively poor predictor of performance in any other task. However, an individual's performance across tasks could be summarized by a principal component which explained a level of total variance above which has previously been accepted as evidence of a general cognitive ability.

They are originally jungle/forest-dwelling birds but now broaden their habitats to urban ‘concrete jungle’ environments such as Tokyo and Sapporo. Despite the close and overlapping range of the habitat between humans and crows, the socio-behavioural function of crows and its psychological and neural underpinnings have been poorly understood. Here, I review the recent studies in animal psychology on inter-individual communication for the understanding of individual-based social ecology of large-billed crows. Particular focuses are made on audiovocal, visual, and tactile communication. First, vocal exchange with a contact call (ka call) and the acoustic individuality of ka calls as an identity signal are outlined. Second topic for visual communication is on audio-visual cross-modal recognition of familiar individuals and the involvement of the individual recognition in the formation and maintenance of dominance relationship. Finally, nonreciprocal but unidirectional allopreening from dominants to subordinates in juvenile males is shown and its possible social function are discussed. To further understand the communication of crows from comparative perspectives, these findings of social behaviour and its function should be integrated with physiological research on the... onto the life-history axis of this species which is characterized by drastic change of social structures between juvenile and pair-bond stages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Izawa","given":"Ei-Ichi"}],"citation-key":"izawaInterindividualCommunicationLargebilled2017","container-title":"Japanese Journal of Animal Psychology","container-title-short":"Japanese Journal of Animal Psychology, The Japanese Journal of Animal Psychology","DOI":"10.2502/janip.67.1.2","ISSN":"0916-8419, 1880-9022","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"ja","page":"11-18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inter-individual communication of large-billed crows: hearing, seeing, and touching","title-short":"Inter-individual communication of large-billed crows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/janip/67/1/67_67.1.2/_article","volume":"67"},{"id":"janickeSEXALLOCATIONADJUSTMENT2013","abstract":"Sex allocation theory is considered as a touchstone of evolutionary biology, providing some of the best supported examples for Darwinian adaptation.

In analogy to local mate competition, Charnov's mating group size model predicts how sex allocation in simultaneous hermaphrodites is affected by the mating group size (i.e., the number of mating partners plus one). Until now, studies have not directly explored the relationship between mating group size and sex allocation, which we here achieve in the simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano. Using transgenic focal worms with ubiquitous expression of green-fluorescent protein (GFP), we assessed the number of wild-type mating partners carrying GFP+ sperm from these focal worms when raised in different social group sizes. This allowed us to test directly how mating group size was related to the sex allocation of focal worms. We find that the proportion of male investment initially increases with increasing mating group size, but then saturates as predicted by theory.

Conventional sex roles assume that the relationship between the number of mates and the fitness of an individual is steeper in males compared with females. Under these conditions, males are expected to be more eager to mate, whereas females are expected to be choosier. Here we hypothesize that the sex allocation, i.e. the reproductive investment devoted to the male versus female function, can be an important predictor of the mating strategy in simultaneous hermaphrodites. We argue that within-species variation in sex allocation can cause differences in the proportional fitness gain derived through each sex function. Individuals should therefore adjust their mating strategy in a way that is more beneficial to the sex function that is relatively more pronounced. To test this, we experimentally manipulated the sex allocation in a simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm and investigated whether this affects the mating behaviour. The results demonstrate that individuals with a more male-biased sex allocation (i.e. relatively large testes and small ovaries) are more eager to mate compared with individuals with a more female-biased sex allocation (i.e. relatively small testes and large ovaries). We argue that this pattern is comparable to conventional gender roles in separate-sexed organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Janicke","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Schärer","given":"Lukas"}],"citation-key":"janickeSexAllocationPredicts2009","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2009.1336","issue":"1676","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,9]]},"page":"4247-4253","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Sex allocation predicts mating rate in a simultaneous hermaphrodite","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2009.1336","volume":"276"},{"id":"jennionsVARIATIONMATECHOICE1997","abstract":"The aim of this review is to consider variation in mating preferences\n \n\namong females. We \n\ndefine mating preferences as the sensory and behavioural properties that\n \n\ninfluence the \n\npropensity of individuals to mate with certain phenotypes. Two properties\n of mating \n\npreferences can be distinguished: (1) ‘preference functions’\n – \n\nthe order with which an \n\nindividual ranks prospective mates and (2) ‘choosiness’ –\n \n\nthe effort an individual is prepared \n\nto invest in mate assessment. Patterns of mate choices can be altered \n\nby changing the costs of \n\nchoosiness without altering the preference function. We discuss why \n\nit is important to study \n\nvariation in female mating behaviour and identify five main areas of \n\ninterest: Variation in \n\nmating preferences and costs of choosiness could (1) influence the \n\nrate and direction of \n\nevolution by sexual selection, (2) provide information about the \n\nevolutionary history of female \n\npreferences, (3) help explain inter-specific differences in the \n\nevolution of secondary sexual \n\ncharacteristics, (4) provide information about the level of benefits \n\ngained from mate choice, (5) \n\nprovide information about the underlying mechanisms of mate choice. \n\nVariation in mate \n\nchoice could be due to variability in preference functions, degree of \n\nchoosiness, or both, and \n\nmay arise due to genetic differences, developmental trajectories or \n\nproximate environmental \n\nfactors. We review the evidence for genetic variation from genetic \n\nstudies of heritability and \n\nalso from data on the repeatability of mate-choice decisions (which \n\ncan provide information \n\nabout the upper limits to heritability). There can be problems in \n\ninterpreting patterns of \n\nmate choice in terms of variation in mating preferences and we \n\nillustrate two main points. \n\nFirst, some factors can lead to mate choice patterns that mimic heritable\n \n\nvariation in \n\npreferences and secondly other factors may obscure heritable preferences.\n \n\nThese factors are \n\ndivided into three overlapping classes, environmental, social and the \n\neffect of the female \n\nphenotype.

Species that reproduce without a larval stage can only disperse by floating or rafting. It is proposed that the colonization processes associated with such direct developing species result in spatial distributions that show relatively greater fine scale patchiness than the distributions of species with a larval dispersal stage. This hypothesis was tested by collecting molluscs at different spatial scales in the Isle of Man. 2 Spatial distribution patterns supported the predictions based on dispersal mode. Estimated variance components for species with larval dispersal suggested that the majority of the spatial variation was associated with variation between shores. In comparison, there was relatively more variability within shores for abundance counts of species with direct development. 3 Multivariate analyses reflected the univariate results. An assemblage of direct developers provided a better discrimination between sites (100 m separation) but the group of species with larval dispersal gave a clearer separation of shores (separated by several km). 4 The fine scale spatial structure of direct developing species was reflected in higher average species diversity within quadrats. Species richness also reflected dispersal mode, with a higher fraction of the regional species pool present for direct developers in comparison to species with larval dispersal. This may reflect the improved local persistence of taxa that avoid the larval dispersal stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"M.

This topic has been the focus of much recent research with nonhuman primates. In this review, we focus on the behavior of the participants in this research—both the animals and the humans—rather than on its cognitive implications. After briefly reviewing theoretical issues and the sensorimotor constraints on primate attention, we describe the ethological and experimental work that has been done. The former, involving observational studies in field and captive settings, focuses on the functions of social attention and on differences in traditional and contemporary micro-ethological techniques. The experimental work is organized in terms of the types of social relationships—solicitous, competitive, collaborative—that the various paradigms establish between subjects or between subject and experimenter. These include co-orientation (gazefollowing) tasks, food-sharing tasks (such as conditional begging, donor choice, and object choice tasks), conspecific competition (such as occluder and informed leader tasks), and collaborative cue production (where subjects must cue an ignorant experimenter). In all of these tasks, we report the relative effectiveness of various attentional cues, including use of the hands (e.g., touching, pointing) and orientation of the body, head, and eyes. In our final discussion, we consider differences in focus in the observational vs experimental approaches (on negotiating social relationships vs access to food, respectively) and suggest ways in which the methods in these two arenas might be successfully integrated.

For both techniques we used morphological measurements of known-age male and female marmots from two independent population studies to build and test predictive models of age class. Both techniques had high predictive power (69–86%) for both sexes and both species. Overall, the two methods performed identically with 81% correct classification. DFA was marginally better at discriminating among older more challenging age classes compared to CART. However, in our test samples, cases with missing values in any of the discriminant variables were deleted and hence unclassified by DFA, whereas CART used values from closely correlated variables to substitute for the missing values. Therefore, overall, CART performed better (CART 81% vs DFA 76%) because of its ability to classify incomplete cases. Correct classification rates were approximately 10% higher for hoary marmots than for Vancouver Island marmots, a result that could be attributed to different sets of morphological measurements. Zygomatic arch breadth measured in hoary marmots was the most important predictor of age class in both sexes using both classification techniques. We recommend that CART analysis be performed on data-sets with incomplete records and used as a variable screening tool prior to DFA on more complete data-sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Karels","given":"Tim J."},{"family":"Bryant","given":"Andrew A."},{"family":"Hik","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"karelsComparisonDiscriminantFunction2004","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12732.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"575-587","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Comparison of discriminant function and classification tree analyses for age classification of marmots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12732.x","volume":"105"},{"id":"karinoAnesthesiaBrainSensory2016","abstract":"Whether anesthesia impacts brain sensory processing is a highly debated and important issue.

By using two extremes of CF1 mice that differ by their exploratory behavior in the Open Field (OF) task (Kazlauckas V, 2005), denominated as Low (LE) and High (HE) Exploratory Mice, the present study evaluated if EE during adulthood could modify the putative differences between LE and HE mice on exploratory behavior, memory performance and hippocampal BDNF levels. To this end, we investigated the effect of adult LE and HE mice after 2months of enriched or standard housing conditions on the open field, on novel object recognition, on the inhibitory avoidance task and on hippocampal BDNF immunocontent. LE showed low exploratory behavior, less retention in the inhibitory avoidance and lower hippocampal BDNF levels. EE enhanced exploratory behavior, memory performance and hippocampal BDNF levels both in LE and HE mice. Importantly, the general profile of LE mice submitted to EE was similar to HE mice housed in standard conditions. These results show that internalized behavior of LE mice can be significantly modified by exposure to an enriched environment even during adulthood.

A regression of the observed richness on that predicted by the model did not indicate any systematic biases, and left residuals that were distributed according to the expected. 3 The model provides a robust working hypothesis, to which we apply a novel approach of quantifying the relative impact of local and regional factors on the species richness of individual pools. Using elasticity analysis of model parameters and invoking elasticity as a measure of parameter ‘importance’ we show, for example, that the impact of regional species richness on the richness of noninteractive communities should always exceed that of the probability of local extinction. 4 The analysis exposes potential difficulties in generalizing which factor – local or regional – has the greater relative importance, and to what extent, as the answer can depend on: (i) the specific factors being compared, and (ii) particular habitat characteristics of individual localities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kiflawi","given":"M."},{"family":"Eitam","given":"A."},{"family":"Blaustein","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"kiflawiRelativeImpactLocal2003","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00712.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","page":"447-452","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The relative impact of local and regional processes on macro-invertebrate species richness in temporary pools","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00712.x","volume":"72"},{"id":"kingMediaPortrayalsMale2007","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine British national newspaper coverage of male and female athletes competing at the Olympic Games since 1948.

We combine two data sets for phenotypic selection, representing more than 4,600 distinct estimates of selection from 143 studies, to evaluate the potential roles of fitness trade-offs, indirect (correlated) selection, temporally varying selection, and stabilizing selection for reducing net directional selection and cumulative responses to selection. We detected little evidence that trade-offs among different fitness components reduced total directional selection in most study systems. Comparisons of selection gradients and selection differentials suggest that correlated selection frequently reduced total selection on size but not on other types of traits. The direction of selection on a trait often changes over time in many temporally replicated studies, but these fluctuations have limited impact in reducing cumulative directional selection in most study systems. Analyses of quadratic selection gradients indicated stabilizing selection on body size in at least some studies but provided little evidence that stabilizing selection is more common than disruptive selection for most traits or study systems.

We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients |β| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of |β| for selection on morphological and on life‐history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of |β| for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients |γ| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of γ values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kingsolver","given":"J.

This fact was confirmed by our novel discovery that eyes will trigger a reflexive shift of attention even when they are presented centrally and are known to be spatially nonpredictive. This exploration of real-world attention also led to our finding that, contrary to popular wisdom, arrows, like eyes, are capable of producing reflexive shifts of attention?a discovery that brings into question much of the existing attention research. We argue that research needs to be grounded in the real world and not in experimental paradigms.

However, no studies have investigated whether scene gist categorization is a general process shared across species, or whether it may be influenced by species-specific adaptive specializations relying on specific low-level scene statistical regularities of the environment. Although pigeons form many types of categorical judgments, little research has examined pigeons’ scene categorization, and no studies have examined pigeons’ ability to do so rapidly. In Experiment 1, pigeons were trained to discriminate between either two basic-level categories (beach vs. mountain) or a superordinate level natural versus a man-made scene category distinction (beach vs. street). The birds successfully learned both tasks to a high degree of accuracy, and transferred their discrimination to novel images. Furthermore, the pigeons successfully discriminated stimuli presented in the .2-.35 s duration range. This indicates that pigeons, a highly divergent species from humans, are also capable of rapid scene categorization, but that they require longer stimulus durations than humans, who can successfully categorize scenes with durations of .027 s or less. Experiment 2 examined whether pigeons make use of complex statistical regularities during scene gist categorization across multiple viewpoints. Pigeons were trained with the two natural categories from Experiment 1 (beach vs. mountain) with zenith (90°), bird's eye (45°), and terrestrial (0°) viewpoints. A sizable portion of the variability in pigeon categorization performance was explained by the systematic variation in scene category-specific statistical regularities, which has also been found with human scene categorization performance. In sum, the current study suggests that rapid scene categorization is a process that is shared across pigeons and humans, but shows a degree of adaptive specialization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirkpatrick","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Bilton","given":"Tannis"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Bruce C."},{"family":"Loschky","given":"Lester C."}],"citation-key":"kirkpatrickSceneGistCategorization2014","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition","DOI":"10.1037/xan0000014","ISSN":"2329-8464, 2329-8456","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"162-177","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Scene gist categorization by pigeons.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xan0000014","volume":"40"},{"id":"kleinFastExactInference","abstract":"We present a novel generative model for natural language tree structures in which semantic (lexical dependency) and syntactic (PCFG) structures are scored with separate models.

Although evidence for such substances abounds, few studies have unraveled their identities, and focus has been exclusively on separate-sex species. We present the first detailed study into the seminal fluid composition of a hermaphrodite (Lymnaea stagnalis). Eight novel peptides and proteins were identified from the seminal-fluid-producing prostate gland and tested for effects on oviposition, hatching and consumption. The gene for the protein found to suppress egg mass production, Ovipostatin, was sequenced, thereby providing the first fully-characterized seminal fluid substance in a simultaneous hermaphrodite.

Usually, sperm donors develop (offensive) traits to enhance their chances in sperm competition, while sperm recipients evolve (defensive) traits that allow them to stay in control of who fathers their offspring. Here, we demonstrate that these processes are also at work in simultaneous hermaphrodites. The hermaphroditic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris uses 40 to 44 copulatory setae to pierce into its partner's skin, causing damage and injecting a substance from its setal glands. Experimental injection of the gland substance indicates that a refractory period may be induced. More importantly, removal of the copulatory setae shows that they influence the partner's sperm uptake. When the setae are present, more sperm are taken up and sperm are distributed more equally over the four spermathecae. We interpret this as a strategy that stacks the odds for the donor's sperm in fertilizing cocoons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Koene","given":"Joris M."},{"family":"Pförtner","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Michiels","given":"Nico K."}],"citation-key":"koenePiercingPartnersSkin2005","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","container-title-short":"Behav Ecol Sociobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s00265-005-0030-y","ISSN":"1432-0762","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"243-249","source":"Springer Link","title":"Piercing the partner's skin influences sperm uptake in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-005-0030-y","volume":"59"},{"id":"komdeurKeepingEnvironmentalChange2021","abstract":"In the current era of rapid climate change, populations are facing environments in which food availability can quickly decline or become highly unpredictable. These conditions may require a high degree of flexibility of individuals and populations to adequately respond to such changes. We propose that the evolution of such high flexibility may be facilitated in social animals that form groups and cooperate in important tasks that critically affect survival and reproduction and ultimately affect adaptive capacity. We argue that sociality is likely to be a key, yet largely overlooked factor that shapes rather than limits the potential for phenotypic plasticity. Cooperatively breeding species are most suitable for studying the influence of both the physical and the social environmental conditions on shaping the phenotypic plasticity of individuals. Cooperative breeders display variation in group size and structure, and in the extent of cooperation and competition between their members. In addition, immigrants may impose costs and/or benefits on other group members, as well as on the whole group. In cooperative breeders, we elucidate why and how group formation and interactions between group members can provide adaptive benefits to some or all individuals in the group. Observed adjustments in social behaviour may be strategic and ultimately enhance individual fitness benefits, and thus improve group and population persistence. Future studies should examine how ecology and sociality together shape the adjustment of animals to rapid and extreme environmental change. In addition to identifying how changes in physical and social factors impact individual behaviour, group formation and sociality, it is crucial to assess associated costs and benefits by exploring the life histories of all group members. Understanding this requires population models, as they integrate all the critical life-history phases, and different types of sociality. We are confident that future research into the ecology and social dynamics will reveal new avenues for the adaptive ability of cooperative breeders and other social species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Komdeur","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Long"}],"citation-key":"komdeurKeepingEnvironmentalChange2021","container-title":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/eth.13200","ISSN":"1439-0310","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"790-807","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Keeping up with environmental change: The importance of sociality","title-short":"Keeping up with environmental change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eth.13200","volume":"127"},{"id":"kondoContactCallsInformation2009","abstract":"The focus of acoustic communication studies differs between birds and primates due to differences between the avian and primate social structures.

Crows looked more rapidly and for a longer duration when the visual and auditory stimuli were incongruent than when congruent.

Therefore, we expected that the configuration of facial features, such as the shape of the bills or eyes, may have enough individuality to permit individual recognition in such species. In this study, we aimed to clarify visible individual differences in the facial configuration of large-billed crows (Corvus macrorhynchos). Specifically, we analysed the profile pictures of 16 crows.

Our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst evidence of vocal exchange using ka calls that are organized following a precise temporal pattern in Large-billed Crows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kondo","given":"Noriko"},{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Shigeru"},{"family":"Izawa","given":"Ei-Ichi"}],"citation-key":"kondoTemporalRuleVocal2010c","container-title":"Ornithological Science","container-title-short":"Ornithological Science","DOI":"10.2326/osj.9.83","ISSN":"1347-0558","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"language":"en","page":"83-91","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Temporal Rule in Vocal Exchange Among Large-Billed Crows <i>Corvus macrorhynchos</i> in Japan","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2326/osj.9.83","volume":"9"},{"id":"konigsbergUncertainPaternityPrimate1992","abstract":"Quantitative genetic studies in primates have generally been based on varying amounts of genealogical information.

Using Henderson's [1988] average numerator relationship matrix method, we show for craniometric data from the Cayo Santiago macaque colony that heritability estimates are not greatly affected by the addition of incomplete paternal information. We then show through simulation studies that in order for there to be a substantial increase in power to detect significant heritabilities, the number of possible sires per offspring must be quite small. Given this restriction, we conclude that the current method of ignoring paternal relationships is probably adequate and that considerable effort would have to be expended in performing paternal exclusions before there would be a substantial increase in the precision of heritability estimates. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Konigsberg","given":"Lyle W."},{"family":"Cheverud","given":"James M."}],"citation-key":"konigsbergUncertainPaternityPrimate1992","container-title":"American Journal of Primatology","DOI":"10.1002/ajp.1350270208","ISSN":"1098-2345","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"en","page":"133-143","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Uncertain paternity in primate quantitative genetic studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajp.1350270208","volume":"27"},{"id":"koriatConstructionCategoryMembership","abstract":"The classification of objects to natural categories displays a great deal of crossperson consensus and within-person consistency.

Fat is accumulated during summer and consumed during the following hibernation season. We investigated the annual time course of energy intake and energy expenditure and their interrelation with seasonal body weight fluctuations and hibernation in captive alpine marmots (Marmota marmota). All animals exhibited an annual body weight cycle with maximum weights in October and minimum weights after termination of hibernation, regardless of food availability during the hibernation season. Both energy uptake and expenditure reached highest values between June and August, when highest rates of body weight gain were observed. Between May and August energy intake exceeded the expenditure by an average of 383 ± 28.3 kJ/d. From September onward, when weight gain in marmots was reduced, the energy balance became less positive. During the normal hibernation season a negative energy balance was observed, even when food was available. Body weight gain in alpine marmots was achieved by a more than 100% enhanced food intake during the summer months. However, this surplus of energy intake could be only partly used for fat accumulation since energetic costs for digestion and catabolism were also considerably increased. The observed annual cycle of energy expenditure reflects to a large extent the metabolic constraints of fat catabolism. The drop in energy expenditure prior to hibernation is therefore at least partly caused by a decreased food intake and body weight gain and seems to be less likely an energy saving mechanism to facilitate further fat accumulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Körtner","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Heldmaier","given":"Gerhard"}],"citation-key":"kortnerBodyWeightCycles1995","container-title":"Physiological Zoology","DOI":"10.1086/physzool.68.1.30163923","ISSN":"0031-935X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",1]]},"page":"149-163","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Body Weight Cycles and Energy Balance in the Alpine Marmot (Marmota marmota)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/physzool.68.1.30163923","volume":"68"},{"id":"kramerFibonacciSeriesTwentiethCentury1973","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kramer","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"kramerFibonacciSeriesTwentiethCentury1973","container-title":"Journal of Music Theory","container-title-short":"Journal of Music Theory","DOI":"10.2307/843120","ISSN":"00222909","issue":"1","issued":{"season":1,"date-parts":[[1973]]},"page":"110","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Fibonacci Series in Twentieth-Century Music","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-2909%28197321%2917%3A1%3C110%3ATFSITM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F&origin=crossref","volume":"17"},{"id":"kriengwatanaRevisitingVocalPerception2015","abstract":"The extent to which human speech perception evolved by taking advantage of predispositions and pre-existing features of vertebrate auditory and cognitive systems remains a central question in the evolution of speech.

Throughout this paper we demonstrate that addressing these issues in non-human animals is relevant and worthwhile because many non-human animals must deal with similar issues in their natural environment. That is, they must also discriminate between similar-sounding vocalizations, determine signaler identity from vocalizations, and resolve signaler-dependent variation in vocalizations from conspecifics. Overall, we find that, although plausible, the current evidence is insufficiently strong to conclude that directional asymmetries in vowel perception are specific to humans, or that non-human animals can use voice characteristics to recognize human individuals. However, we do find some indication that non-human animals can normalize speaker differences.

In this paper, we describe factors affecting the reproductive success of male and female red deer (Cervus elaphus) on the island of Rum, Scotland. Birthweight was a significant determinant of total lifetime reproductive success in males, with heavier-born males being more successful than lighter ones. In contrast, birthweight did not affect female reproductive success. High population density and cold spring temperatures in the year of birth decreased several components of fitness in females, but did not affect the breeding success of males. The results confirm the prediction that selection on a sexually dimorphic trait should be greater in males than in females, and explain the differential maternal expenditure between sons and daughters observed in red deer.

Using both simulation studies and empirical data from wild populations, we demonstrate the ability of the animal model to reduce bias due to shared environment effects such as maternal or brood effects, especially where pedigrees contain multiple generations and immigration rates are low. However, where common environment effects are strong, a combination of both cross-fostering and an animal model provides the best way to avoid bias. We illustrate ways of partitioning phenotypic variance into components of additive genetic, maternal genetic, maternal environment, common environment, permanent environment and temporal effects, but also show how substantial confounding between these different effects may occur. Whilst the flexibility of the mixed model approach is extremely useful for incorporating the spatial, temporal and social heterogeneity typical of natural populations, the advantages will inevitably be restricted by the quality of pedigree information and care needs to be taken in specifying models that are appropriate to the data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kruuk","given":"L.

Significant differences in temporal and frequency variables of calls were found between fledglings and adults, whereas females' and males' calls turned out to differ only in two parameters of the commonest call type ('chwee-ow'). Despite sex-related differences in this call, partners appeared to utter similar versions of it, which suggests that mate vocal mimicry might occur.

Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lande","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Stevan J."}],"citation-key":"landeMeasurementSelectionCorrelated1983","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.2307/2408842","ISSN":"0014-3820","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"page":"1210-1226","publisher":"[Society for the Study of Evolution, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2408842","volume":"37"},{"id":"landEyeMovementsVertebrates2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Land","given":"Michael F."}],"citation-key":"landEyeMovementsVertebrates2015","container-title":"Journal of Comparative Physiology A","container-title-short":"J Comp Physiol A","DOI":"10.1007/s00359-014-0964-5","ISSN":"0340-7594, 1432-1351","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2]]},"language":"en","page":"195-214","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Eye movements of vertebrates and their relation to eye form and function","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00359-014-0964-5","volume":"201"},{"id":"laneDelayedPhenologyReduced2012","abstract":"Delay in the hibernation emergence date of female Columbian ground squirrels in Canada over 20 years is related to climatic conditions other than increasing temperature, and as years of later emergence are associated with decreased individual fitness, plastic responses to climate change may be associated with declines in population viability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lane","given":"Jeffrey E."},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E.

Generally, pair disruption resulted in one of the pair members staying on the territory and re-pairing with a younger incomer, whereas the other disappeared from the territory. Replaced individuals were rarely found as dominant in a territory but were often injured or found dead. Individuals gained no benefit from mate switching: new mates were neither heavier, larger, or more heterozygote nor more genetically compatible than previous mates. Moreover, no increase in reproductive success was observed after re-pairing. The relationship between reproductive failure and occurrence of mate change was mainly due to infanticide by the incomer. Our results support the “forced divorce” hypothesis in the Alpine marmot and suggest that mate switching has strong consequences on breeding success. We discuss the importance of taking into account the cases of forced divorce while studying mate switching process and its evolutionary consequences in monogamous species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Lardy","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Figueroa","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"lardyMateChangeSocially2011","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arq168","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1,1]]},"page":"120-125","source":"Silverchair","title":"Mate change in a socially monogamous mammal: evidences support the “forced divorce” hypothesis","title-short":"Mate change in a socially monogamous mammal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arq168","volume":"22"},{"id":"laudenslagerCopingImmunosuppressionInescapable1983","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Laudenslager","given":"Mark L."},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Susan M."},{"family":"Drugan","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Hyson","given":"Richard L."},{"family":"Maier","given":"Steven F."}],"citation-key":"laudenslagerCopingImmunosuppressionInescapable1983","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.6603018","issue":"4610","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983",8,5]]},"page":"568-570","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"Coping and Immunosuppression: Inescapable But Not Escapable Shock Suppresses Lymphocyte Proliferation","title-short":"Coping and Immunosuppression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.6603018","volume":"221"},{"id":"lawrenceVocalCharacteristicsCall2005","abstract":"Some vocal characteristics and call variation in the Australian crows and ravens were studied by sonagraphic analysis of tape-recorded calls.

These results suggest that categorization of ﬂowers and people may be controlled primarily by the overall shape of the object rather than by local features, whereas categorization of cars and chairs may rely primarily on local features rather than the overall shape of the object.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lazareva","given":"Olga F."},{"family":"Freiburger","given":"Kate L."},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"lazarevaEffectsStimulusManipulations2006","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2006.03.004","ISSN":"03766357","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",6]]},"language":"en","page":"224-233","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of stimulus manipulations on visual categorization in pigeons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376635706000908","volume":"72"},{"id":"lazarevaPigeonsConcurrentlyCategorize2004","author":[{"family":"Lazareva","given":"Olga F"},{"family":"Freiburger","given":"Kate L"},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A"}],"citation-key":"lazarevaPigeonsConcurrentlyCategorize2004","container-title":"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review","DOI":"10.3758/bf03196745","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"1111-1117","source":"Zotero","title":"Pigeons concurrently categorize photographs at both basic and superordinate levels","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},{"id":"lazarevaTranspositionPigeonsReassessing2005","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lazareva","given":"Olga F."},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Young","given":"Michael E."}],"citation-key":"lazarevaTranspositionPigeonsReassessing2005","container-title":"Animal Learning & Behavior","container-title-short":"Animal Learning & Behavior","DOI":"10.3758/BF03196048","ISSN":"0090-4996, 1532-5830","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",2]]},"language":"en","page":"22-46","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transposition in pigeons: reassessing spence (1937) with multiple discrimination training","title-short":"Transposition in pigeons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/BF03196048","volume":"33"},{"id":"leaDiscriminationFivedimensionalStimuli","author":[{"family":"Lea","given":"Stephen E G"},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Catriona M E"}],"citation-key":"leaDiscriminationFivedimensionalStimuli","language":"en","page":"25","source":"Zotero","title":"Discrimination of Five-dimensional Stimuli by Pigeons: Limitations of Feature Analysis","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"leaDiscriminationPolymorphousStimulus1978","abstract":"Pigeons were trained to perform a visual discrimination between stimulus sets in which the presence of any two of three positive features made a stimulus positive, while any two of three negative features made it negative (there were thus three different positive and three different negative stimuli). After training, the birds were exposed to test stimuli that contained either all three positive or all three negative features. In Experiment I three pigeons were successfully trained by a successive method, and subsequently responded to the test stimuli as though they were positive or negative respectively. In Experiment II four pigeons were trained by a simultaneous method. Three learned the discrimination and generalized appropriately to the test stimuli, but they showed no preference between positive test and positive training stimuli, nor any consistent difference in speed of response to them; and similar results were found for negative stimuli. It is argued from this that the pigeons learned to respond to the stimuli as patterns (configurations of features) rather than to the constituent features, but that they generalized to the test stimuli by using the common features. The experiments show that pigeons could in principle learn to discriminate natural polymorphous classes (such as “pigeon” or “person”) without using any single feature, but neither the present experiments nor earlier ones demonstrating discriminations of such natural classes establish that pigeons make use of polymorphous concepts in the same way as people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lea","given":"S.

Therefore, a mechanism for the discrimination of kin from non-kin is likely to be critical for individuals of many social species to maximize their inclusive fitness. Evidence suggests that genetic cues to kinship are rare and that learned or environmental cues offer a more parsimonious explanation for kin recognition in most contexts. This is particularly true among cooperatively breeding birds, where recognition of familiar individuals is usually regarded as the most plausible mechanism for kin discrimination. In this article, we first review the evidence that familiarity provides an effective decision rule for discrimination of kin from non-kin in social birds. We then consider some of the complexities of familiarity as a cue to kinship, especially the problems of how individuals become familiar, and how familiar individuals are recognized. We conclude that while familiarity as a mechanism for kin recognition may be more parsimonious and widespread than genetic mechanisms, its apparent simplicity as a decision rule governing social interactions may be deceptive. Finally, we identify directions for future research on familiarity as a kin recognition mechanism in social birds and other taxa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Leedale","given":"Amy E."},{"family":"Li","given":"Jianqiang"},{"family":"Hatchwell","given":"Ben J."}],"citation-key":"leedaleKithKinFamiliarity2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples.

Here, we evaluated the influence of an audience’s attitude on professional actors’ head orientation and gaze direction during two theatrical performances with controlled observers’ reactions (Hostile vs Friendly audience). First, our speech fluency analysis confirmed that an audience’s attitude influenced actors’ emotions. Second, we found that, whereas actors oriented more their head to the left (i.e. Right Hemisphere Bias) when the audience was hostile, they gazed more straight ahead at Friendly spectators. These results are in accordance with the Valence-Specific Hypothesis that proposes that processing stimuli with negative valences involves the right hemisphere (i.e. left eye) more than the left hemisphere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemasson","given":"Alban"},{"family":"Lippi","given":"Daria"},{"family":"Hamelin","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Louazon","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"}],"citation-key":"lemassonPublicAttitudeInfluences2020","container-title":"Interaction Studies","DOI":"10.1075/is.19009.lem","ISSN":"1572-0373, 1572-0381","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"428-439","source":"www.jbe-platform.com","title":"Public attitude influences actors’ visual orientation*: A pilot experimental study","title-short":"Public attitude influences actors’ visual orientation*","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/is.19009.lem","volume":"21"},{"id":"len-riosRepresentationWomenNews2005","abstract":"This study uses a feminist framework of masculine cultural hegemony to examine the representation of women in two newspapers—a medium-sized newspaper (Study 1) and a larger newspaper (Study 2).

Using temporal and spatial datasets of three rodent species distributed across different climatic zones in China, we investigated temporal and spatial trends of body size (length and mass), identified the critical drivers of these trends, and inferred the potential causes underlying the distinct body-size responses to the critical drivers. We found that body mass of all species remained stable over time and across space. Body length, however, increased in one species over time and in two species across space. Generally, body-length variation was predicted best by minimum ambient temperature. Moreover, in two species, body length changed linearly with temperature differences between ancestral and colonization areas. These distinct temperature–length patterns may jointly be caused by species-specific temperature sensitivities and experienced magnitudes of warming. We hypothesize that species or populations distributed across distinct temperature gradients evolved different intrinsic temperature sensitivities, which affect how their body sizes respond to warming climates. Our results suggest that size trends associated with climate change should be explored at higher temporal and spatial resolutions, and include clades of species with similar distributions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Sommer","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zaixue"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yongwang"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Yaxian"},{"family":"Ozgul","given":"Arpat"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Deng"}],"citation-key":"liDistinctBodysizeResponses2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2022.0015","issue":"1972","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"page":"20220015","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Distinct body-size responses to warming climate in three rodent species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2022.0015","volume":"289"},{"id":"LingueeDictionnaireAnglaisfrancais","abstract":"Dictionnaire anglais-français avec des millions de phrases traduites en anglais-français.

Recently, Liu, Rubin, and Wu demonstrated that expanding the parameter space along with augmenting the missing data is useful for accelerating iterative computation in an EM algorithm. The main purpose of this article is to rigorously define a parameter expanded data augmentation (PX-DA) algorithm and to study its theoretical properties. The PX-DA is a special way of using auxiliary variables to accelerate Gibbs sampling algorithms and is closely related to reparameterization techniques. We obtain theoretical results concerning the convergence rate of the PX-DA algorithm and the choice of prior for the expansion parameter. To understand the role of the expansion parameter, we establish a new theory for iterative conditional sampling under the transformation group formulation, which generalizes the standard Gibbs sampler. Using the new theory, we show that the PX-DA algorithm with a Haar measure prior (often improper) for the expansion parameter is always proper and is optimal among a class of such algorithms including reparameterization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Jun S."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Ying Nian"}],"citation-key":"liuParameterExpansionData1999","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","DOI":"10.2307/2669940","ISSN":"0162-1459","issue":"448","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"page":"1264-1274","publisher":"[American Statistical Association, Taylor & Francis, Ltd.]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Parameter Expansion for Data Augmentation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2669940","volume":"94"},{"id":"Login","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,9]]},"citation-key":"Login","title":"Login","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.zotero.org/user/login/"},{"id":"lubowHIGHORDERCONCEPTFORMATION1974","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lubow","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"lubowHIGHORDERCONCEPTFORMATION1974","container-title":"Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","DOI":"10.1901/jeab.1974.21-475","ISSN":"00225002","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1974",5]]},"language":"en","page":"475-483","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"HIGH-ORDER CONCEPT FORMATION IN THE PIGEON <sup>1</sup>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1901/jeab.1974.21-475","volume":"21"},{"id":"ludwigMultipleMatingSperm2008","abstract":"Aplysia californica, a simultaneous hermaphrodite, has the ability to store and digest allosperm and frequently mates with multiple partners.

The majority of studies on vocal similarity have been focussing on the songs of birds rather than their calls, with evidence for vocal similarity in calls being rather scarce. Here, we investigated whether ravens make their calls acoustically similar to one another by analysing the extent to which short- and long-distance calls of their vocal repertoires exhibited vocal similarity. Our results showed that long-distance calls, but not short-distance calls, are highly similar between pair partners. This effect may be explained by the different functions underlying short- and long-distance communication in ravens, with vocal similarity possibly being scaffolded by specific social matrices such as pair-bonds and/or strong social relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Luef","given":"Eva Maria"},{"family":"Ter Maat","given":"Andries"},{"family":"Pika","given":"Simone"}],"citation-key":"luefVocalSimilarityLongdistance2017","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2017.05.013","ISSN":"0376-6357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-7","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Vocal similarity in long-distance and short-distance vocalizations in raven pairs (Corvus corax) in captivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635717302255","volume":"142"},{"id":"lukaszewiczNonadditiveGeneticEffects2001","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lukaszewicz","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"lukaszewiczNonadditiveGeneticEffects2001","container-title":"Journal of Applied Genetics","ISSN":"1234-1983","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"EN","publisher":"-","source":"agro.icm.edu.pl","title":"Non-additive genetic effects in animal selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://agro.icm.edu.pl/agro/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-2c91df5b-2ebf-4493-9bd5-969469641ac8","volume":"42"},{"id":"lynchGeneticsAnalysisQuantitative1998","abstract":"AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Lynch","given":"Michael"},{"family":"1951-","given":""},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"1957-","given":""}],"citation-key":"lynchGeneticsAnalysisQuantitative1998","ISBN":"9780878934812","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Sinauer","source":"agris.fao.org","title":"Genetics and analysis of quantitative traits","type":"report","URL":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Genetics+and+analysis+of+quantitative+traits&author=Lynch%2C+Michael&publication_year=1998"},{"id":"macarthurEquilibriumTheoryInsular1963","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"MacArthur","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Edward O."}],"citation-key":"macarthurEquilibriumTheoryInsular1963","container-title":"Evolution","container-title-short":"Evolution","DOI":"10.2307/2407089","ISSN":"00143820","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1963",12]]},"language":"en","page":"373","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Equilibrium Theory of Insular Zoogeography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2407089?origin=crossref","volume":"17"},{"id":"macarthurTheoryIslandBiogeography2016","abstract":"Biogeography was stuck in a \"natural history phase\" dominated by the collection of data, the young Princeton biologists Robert H.

The question of whether males can adapt their behaviour in order to accentuate these preferred aspects has received less attention. Male bowerbirds provide an excellent system in which to address this question. Males build and decorate structures—bowers—which females use to assess males. Males exhibiting high numbers of particular decorations on their bowers receive increased mating success. Males can choose what objects to place on bowers and where to put them. Therefore, their behaviour can directly influence their mating success. I studied a population of spotted bowerbirds Chlamydera maculata in central Queensland, Australia. I show, using two sets of observations and a choice experiment, that males exhibit strong and consistent preferences for certain objects. The male's preferences have an adaptive value, targeting objects that predict his mating success. Such behaviour operates at three levels. Fundamentally, object selection and acquisition is biased in favour of certain objects for use as decorations. These decorations are then placed prominently on the bower, within the avenue. Finally, males actively proffer influential decorations, used as props, to visiting females, ensuring that crucial components of the sexual display cannot be ignored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Madden","given":"Joah R."}],"citation-key":"maddenMaleSpottedBowerbirds2003","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","container-title-short":"Behav Ecol Sociobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s00265-003-0582-7","ISSN":"1432-0762","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"263-268","source":"Springer Link","title":"Male spotted bowerbirds preferentially choose, arrange and proffer objects that are good predictors of mating success","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-003-0582-7","volume":"53"},{"id":"maioranoThreatsClimateChange2013","abstract":"We identified hotspots of terrestrial vertebrate species diversity in Europe and adjacent islands.

In particular, we considered the entire European sub-continent plus Turkey and a total of 1149 species of terrestrial vertebrates. For each species, we developed species-specific expert-based distribution models (validated against field data) which we used to calculate species richness maps for mammals, breeding birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Considering four global circulation model outputs and three emission scenarios, we generated an index of risk of exposure to extreme climates, and we used a bivariate local Moran’s I to identify the areas with a significant association between hotspots of diversity and high risk of exposure to extreme climates. Our results outline that the Mediterranean basin represents both an important hotspot for biodiversity and especially for threatened species for all taxa. In particular, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas host particularly high species richness as measured over all groups, while the eastern Mediterranean basin is particularly rich in amphibians and reptiles; the islands (both Macaronesian and Mediterranean) host the highest richness of threatened species for all taxa occurs.

In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an \"optimal\" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed.

In short, they can conceptualize the world. This apparent uniqueness leads to an immediate puzzle: WHEN and HOW does this abstract system come into being? To answer this question we need to explore the origins of adult concepts, both developmentally and phylogenetically; When does the developing child acquire the ability to use abstract concepts?; does the transition occur around 2 years, with the onset of symbolic representation and language? Or, is it independent of the emergence of language?; when in evolutionary history did an abstract representational system emerge?; is there something unique about the human brain? How would a computational system operating on the basis of perceptual associations develop into a system operating on the basis of abstract relations?; is this ability present in other species, but masked by their inability to verbalise abstractions? Perhaps the very notion of concepts is empty and should be done away with altogether. This book tackles the age-old puzzle of what might be unique about human concepts. Intuitively, we have a sense that our thoughts are somehow different from those of animals and young children such as infants. Yet, if true, this raises the question of where and how this uniqueness arises. What are the factors that have played out during the life course of the individual and over the evolution of humans that have contributed to the emergence of this apparently unique ability? This volume brings together a collection of world specialists who have grappled with these questions from different perspectives to try to resolve the issue. It includes contributions from leading psychologists, neuroscientists, child and infant specialists, and animal cognition specialists. Taken together, this story leads to the idea that there is no unique ingredient in the emergence of human concepts, but rather a powerful and potentially unique mix of biological abilities and personal and social history that has led to where the human mind now stands.A 'must-read' for students and researchers in the cognitive sciences.","author":[{"family":"Mareschal","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Quinn","given":"Paul C."},{"family":"Lea","given":"Stephen E.

Understanding the relative importance of these episodes is challenging, particularly because the relevant postcopulatory fitness components are often difficult to assess. Here, we investigate different episodes of sexual selection on the male sex function, by assessing how (precopulatory) mating success, and (postcopulatory) sperm-transfer efficiency and sperm-fertilizing efficiency contribute to male reproductive success. Specifically, we used a transgenic line of the transparent flatworm, Macrostomum lignano, which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in all cell types, including sperm cells, enabling in vivo sperm tracking and paternity analysis. We found that a large proportion of variance in male reproductive success arose from the postcopulatory episodes. Moreover, we also quantified selection differentials on 10 morphological traits. Testis size and seminal vesicle size showed significant positive selection differentials, which were mainly due to selection on sperm-transfer efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that male reproductive success in M. lignano is not primarily limited by the number of matings achieved, but rather by the ability to convert matings into successful fertilizations, which is facilitated by producing many sperm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Marie-Orleach","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Janicke","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Vizoso","given":"Dita B."},{"family":"David","given":"Patrice"},{"family":"Schärer","given":"Lukas"}],"citation-key":"marie-orleachQuantifyingEpisodesSexual2016","container-title":"Evolution","container-title-short":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/evo.12861","ISSN":"0014-3820","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,1]]},"page":"314-328","source":"Silverchair","title":"Quantifying episodes of sexual selection: Insights from a transparent worm with fluorescent sperm","title-short":"Quantifying episodes of sexual selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12861","volume":"70"},{"id":"marlerAvianPrimateCommunication1982","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Marler","given":"Peter R."}],"citation-key":"marlerAvianPrimateCommunication1982","container-title":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","container-title-short":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/0149-7634(82)90010-0","ISSN":"01497634","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982",3]]},"language":"en","page":"87-94","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Avian and primate communication: The problem of natural categories","title-short":"Avian and primate communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0149763482900100","volume":"6"},{"id":"martelDriftingDispersalSmall1991","abstract":"Quantitative evidence that several marine benthic invertebrates lacking a planktonic larval stage disperse as juveniles and small adults by drifting in the water column has been obtained using off-bottom intertidal collectors. These collectors were mimics of a habitat commonly used by small molluscs in intertidal seaweed communities: red turf algae. Taxa caught in collectors include three brooding bivalves [Musculus sp., Lasaea sp., Transenneilatantilla(Gould, 1853)] and small gastropods that produce benthic egg capsules and crawl-away juveniles (Barleeiaspp.). Dispersal is accomplished by juveniles - - and even sexually mature adults in the case of small-sized species - - drifting with water currents using mucous threads in at least some of the taxa found. Some of these molluscs have also been caught in off-bottom collectors placed away from the shore, in the middle of a bay. Findings indicate that, contrary to what is suggested by their mode of development, these invertebrates have alternative and likely effective dispersal mechanisms (at least at a local scale). It is probable that frequent drifting excursions in these taxa enhance rafting opportunities, which in turn may favor long distance dispersal. Large numbers of juveniles of several other species of molluscs whose life cycles include a planktonic larval stage were also caught in off-bottom collectors. These results, coupled with those from previous studies, show that postmetamorphic drifting is a common feature of the life history and ecology of many marine bivalves and gastropods, regardless of their mode of development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Martel","given":"André"},{"family":"Chia","given":"Fu-Shiang"}],"citation-key":"martelDriftingDispersalSmall1991","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/0022-0981(91)90111-9","ISSN":"00220981","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991",7]]},"language":"en","page":"131-147","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Drifting and dispersal of small bivalves and gastropods with direct development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022098191901119","volume":"150"},{"id":"martellaVocalizationsMonkParakeet1990","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Martella","given":"Mónica B."},{"family":"Bucher","given":"Enrique H."}],"citation-key":"martellaVocalizationsMonkParakeet1990","container-title":"Bird Behavior","container-title-short":"Bird Behavior","DOI":"10.3727/015613890791784290","ISSN":"01561383","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101-110","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Vocalizations of the Monk Parakeet","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&issn=0156-1383&volume=8&issue=2&spage=101","volume":"8"},{"id":"martenSoundTransmissionIts1977","author":[{"family":"Marten","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Marler","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"martenSoundTransmissionIts1977","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1977"]]},"language":"en","page":"271-290","source":"Zotero","title":"Sound transmission and its significance for animal vocalization","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"martinEyePasseriformBird1986","abstract":"The European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, is a diurnal, ground feeding bird of the order Passeriformes.

Such patterns may be driven by dispersal limitation, species–area relationships, hierarchical niche requirements, or occur as an artefact of passive sampling. Despite its widespread occurrence, few studies have explored the factors underlying nested subset structure, and ecological distinctions between nested and non-nested (idiosyncratic) taxa within a region have been largely ignored. 2 Macroinvertebrate assemblages from 45 heathland ponds in south-west England are used to (i) unravel the relative importance of processes driving nested subset structure and (ii) test spatially explicit hypotheses concerning the response of nested and idiosyncratic taxa to parameters shown to structure assemblage-level nestedness. 3 Despite being dominated by taxa with good powers of inter-site dispersal, pond macroinvertebrate assemblages were found to be significantly nested. This nesting was not due to passive sampling, and was best explained by pond area, with habitat parameters and isolation being of secondary importance. 4 The spatial responses of nested and idiosyncratic taxa matched predictions; nested taxa showed strong spatial structure, which was reduced when the effects of pond area and habitat were removed. In contrast, a greater proportion of idiosyncratic taxa were completely spatially random and exhibited weaker responses to factors that structure assemblage level nestedness. 5 Nested and idiosyncratic species tend to differ ecologically: idiosyncratic taxa generally possess broad ecological tolerance and good dispersal capacity, whilst nested species are more likely to have narrow tolerances or limited powers of dispersal. 6 Factors structuring nestedness in ponds can be viewed as probabilistic filters which act to limit the spatial distribution of species with narrow ecological tolerance or low dispersal tendency. Nestedness analysis alone fails to elucidate processes that structure assemblage composition. The additional use of spatially explicit analyses is important if processes that generate nested pattern across a region are to be understood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"McABENDROTH","given":"L."},{"family":"Foggo","given":"A."},{"family":"Rundle","given":"S.

Playbacks of nestlings' begging calls to adults and parents' approach calls to nestlings showed that mutual recognition of each other's ca/Is is learned between nestling age of 14 and 20 days. Sonographic and statistical analyses of the begging calls of nestling and fledgling jays showed the calls to be highly individualistic. Both univariate and multivariate (PCA) statistical methods were used to determine amounts of significant variation within and among the calls of different individuals and to isolate parameters which might be used by parents in offspring recognition. The analyses support two major conclusions. First, 20.4 ~ of all variance measured in the calls is due to variation among individuals' calls. The data imply that adults may recognize their offspring's calls based on gestalt perception of simultaneous variation in a number of parameters. Second, each young bird's calls vary gradually with time, requiring parents to 'track' the calls of their offspring over time.

However, maladaptation, an evolved decrease in fitness, may also occur in response to natural selection under some conditions. Social selection, which arises from the effects of social partners on fitness, has been identified as a potential cause of maladaptation, but we lack a general rule identifying when social selection should lead to a decrease in population mean fitness. Here we use a quantitative genetic model to develop such a rule. We show that maladaptation is most likely to occur when social selection is strong relative to nonsocial selection and acts in an opposing direction. In this scenario, the evolution of traits that impose fitness costs on others may outweigh evolved gains in fitness for the individual, leading to a net decrease in population mean fitness. Furthermore, we find that maladaptation may also sometimes occur when phenotypes of interacting individuals negatively covary. We outline the biological situations where maladaptation in response to social selection can be expected, provide both quantitative genetic and phenotypic versions of our derived result, and suggest what empirical work would be needed to test it. We also consider the effect of social selection on inclusive fitness and support previous work showing that inclusive fitness cannot suffer an evolutionary decrease. Taken together, our results show that social selection may decrease population mean fitness when it opposes individual-level selection, even as inclusive fitness increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"McGlothlin","given":"Joel W"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"David N"}],"citation-key":"mcglothlinSocialSelectionEvolution2022","container-title":"Journal of Heredity","DOI":"10.1093/jhered/esab061","editor":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Kimberly"}],"ISSN":"0022-1503, 1465-7333","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,17]]},"language":"en","page":"61-68","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social Selection and the Evolution of Maladaptation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/113/1/61/6446857","volume":"113"},{"id":"mcgrawEstimationIndividualFitness1996","abstract":"Fitness is a vague, poorly developed concept in ecology and evolutionary biology.

Instead, particularly in studies of natural selection, components of fitness are measured as surrogates for fitness. In this article, we develop an integrated measure of fitness based on the philosophical underpinnings provided by the notion of propensity fitness, combined with classical demographic methods. We show how life-history data, collected for an individual, can be formatted as an age-structured population projection matrix, A(m). The dominant eigenvalue, λ(m), of this matrix is an estimate of that individual's propensity fitness. Using life-history data sets on European sparrowhawks and blue tits, we show that the interpretation of analyses of selection can shift radically using the integrated propensity fitness measure instead of components of fitness, such as lifetime reproductive output. Individual fitness, as formulated here, provides an integrated measure of performance that should prove useful in empirical studies in ecology and evolutionary biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"McGraw","given":"James B."},{"family":"Caswell","given":"Hal"}],"citation-key":"mcgrawEstimationIndividualFitness1996","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/285839","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",1]]},"page":"47-64","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Estimation of Individual Fitness from Life-History Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285839","volume":"147"},{"id":"medinContextTheoryClassification","author":[{"family":"Medin","given":"Douglas L"},{"family":"Schaffer","given":"Marguerite M"},{"family":"College","given":"Barnard"}],"citation-key":"medinContextTheoryClassification","language":"en","page":"32","source":"Zotero","title":"Context Theory of Classification Learning","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"medinContextTheoryClassification1978","author":[{"family":"Medin","given":"Douglas L"},{"family":"Schaffer","given":"Marguerite M"}],"citation-key":"medinContextTheoryClassification1978","DOI":"10.1037/0033-295X.85.3.207","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1978"]]},"language":"en","page":"207","source":"Zotero","title":"Context Theory of Classification Learning","type":"article-journal","volume":"85"},{"id":"medinStrategiesClassificationLearning1981","author":[{"family":"Medin","given":"Douglas L"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Edward E"}],"citation-key":"medinStrategiesClassificationLearning1981","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981"]]},"language":"en","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"Strategies and Classification Learning","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"mehlQuantitativeTextAnalysis2006","abstract":"Text analysis has been receiving increasing attention within the social sciences.

However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing – and exclusion – of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known – and not known – about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed – and these must employ better inferential methods – before general conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we hope that the present paper and special issue provide inspiration for future research and guidelines on best practices for its execution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Merilä","given":"Juha"},{"family":"Hendry","given":"Andrew P."}],"citation-key":"merilaClimateChangeAdaptation2014","container-title":"Evolutionary Applications","DOI":"10.1111/eva.12137","ISSN":"1752-4571","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2013 The Authors.

One explanation proposed for this paradox is that a genetic response to selection may be masked by opposing changes in the environment5,6. We used data from a 20-year study of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) to explore selection on, and evolution of, a heritable trait: relative body weight at fledging (‘condition’). Despite consistent positive directional selection, on both the phenotypic and the additive genetic component (breeding values, estimated from an animal model) of condition, the mean phenotypic value of this trait in the population has declined, rather than increased, over time. Here we show that, despite this decline, the mean breeding value for condition has increased over time. The mismatch between response to selection at the levels of genotype and phenotype can be explained by environmental deterioration, concealing underlying evolution. This form of cryptic evolution may be common in natural environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Merilä","given":"J."},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"L. E.

Here, we examine several well-known ecogeographical rules, especially those pertaining to body size in contemporary, historical and fossil taxa. We review the evidence showing that rules of geographical variation in response to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological changes through time in response to climate change. These rules hold at various time scales, ranging from contemporary to geological time scales. Patterns of body size variation in response to climate change at the individual species level may also be detected at the community level. The patterns underlying ecotypic variation are complex and highly context-dependent, reducing the ‘predictive-power’ of ecogeographical rules. This is especially true when considering the increasing impact of human activities on the environment. Nonetheless, ecogeographical rules may help interpret the likely influences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems. Global climate change has already influenced the body size of several contemporary species, and will likely have an even greater impact on animal communities in the future. For this reason, we highlight and emphasise the importance of museum specimens and the continued need for documenting the earth's biological diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Millien","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Kathleen Lyons","given":"S."},{"family":"Olson","given":"Link"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Felisa A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Anthony B."},{"family":"Yom-Tov","given":"Yoram"}],"citation-key":"millienEcotypicVariationContext2006","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00928.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"853-869","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ecotypic variation in the context of global climate change: revisiting the rules","title-short":"Ecotypic variation in the context of global climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00928.x","volume":"9"},{"id":"millienRelativeEffectsClimate2004","abstract":"Aim This paper examines body size variation in both recent and Quaternary populations of the Japanese ﬁeld mouse Apodemus argenteus in order to assess the relative effects on body size of climate change, isolation and competitive interactions with its congeneric A. speciosus.

We investigated the relationship between the ability to solve an associative learning task and group size among individuals of a free-living, social bird, the Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis). Individuals varied in their likelihood of interacting with and solving the task. Individuals from larger groups were more likely to approach the associative learning task, suggesting that group size influences individual propensity to attempt a novel task. However, group size did not influence the likelihood that individuals solved the task. Rather, age had an important effect; adults were more likely to solve the association task than juveniles. Our finding that free-living individuals occurring in large social groups were more likely to interact with a novel task suggests that group size may affect differences in performance at a cognitive task within a species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Mirville","given":"Melanie O."},{"family":"Kelley","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Ridley","given":"Amanda R."}],"citation-key":"mirvilleGroupSizeAssociative2016","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","ISSN":"0340-5443","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"417-427","publisher":"Springer","source":"JSTOR","title":"Group size and associative learning in the Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/44856987","volume":"70"},{"id":"mohammedEnvironmentalEnrichmentBrain2002","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Mohammed","given":"A.H."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"S.W."},{"family":"Darmopil","given":"S."},{"family":"Hjerling-Leffler","given":"J."},{"family":"Ernfors","given":"P."},{"family":"Winblad","given":"B."},{"family":"Diamond","given":"M.C."},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"P.S."},{"family":"Bogdanovic","given":"N."}],"citation-key":"mohammedEnvironmentalEnrichmentBrain2002","container-title":"Progress in Brain Research","DOI":"10.1016/S0079-6123(02)38074-9","ISBN":"978-0-444-50981-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","page":"109-133","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Environmental enrichment and the brain","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079612302380749","volume":"138"},{"id":"mohammedEnvironmentalEnrichmentBrain2002a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Mohammed","given":"A.

Among vertebrates, phenotypic plasticity is known to underlie most of this phenological change, while evidence for micro-evolution is very limited and challenging to obtain. In this study, we quantified phenotypic and genetic trends in timing of spring migration using 8,032 dates of arrival at the breeding grounds obtained from observations on 1,715 individual common terns (Sterna hirundo) monitored across 27 years, and tested whether these trends were consistent with predictions of a micro-evolutionary response to selection. We observed a strong phenotypic advance of 9.3 days in arrival date, of which c. 5% was accounted for by an advance in breeding values. The Breeder’s equation and Robertson’s Secondary Theorem of Selection predicted qualitatively similar evolutionary responses to selection, and these theoretical predictions were largely consistent with our estimated genetic pattern. Overall, our study provides rare evidence for micro-evolution underlying (part of) an adaptive response to climate change in the wild, and illustrates how a combination of adaptive micro-evolution and phenotypic plasticity facilitated a shift towards earlier spring migration in this free-living population of common terns.Empirical evidence for evolutionary change underlying vertebrate adaptation to current global change is very rare. This may be due to phenotypic plasticity being the main mechanism underlying adaptation, or to challenges associated with the empirical testing of genetic changes in the wild, in particular data limitations. In this study, we tested whether an observed phenotypic advance in the timing of arrival from spring migration in a wild seabird population was due to an evolutionary response (i.e., genetic change) and/or to phenotypic plasticity or other non-genetic effects. To do so, we applied a bivariate “animal model” to a 27-year data set from a pedigreed population of common terns located at the North Sea coast of Germany. We found an evolutionary response to selection favoring earlier arriving individuals. Additionally, we could show that two different theoretical models predict a qualitatively similar evolutionary response as the one we estimated, both in terms of direction and magnitude. As such, our study provides a rare empirical case where estimated and predicted evolutionary responses agree, and suggests an evolutionary response in the timing of avian spring migration, although it played a smaller role than phenotypic plasticity in the common tern response to rapid climate change. Overall, these findings show the use of disentangling the relative, and often complementary, contributions of plastic and evolutionary changes to better understand adaptive processes and predict responses to future changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Moiron","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Teplitsky","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Haest","given":"Birgen"},{"family":"Charmantier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Bouwhuis","given":"Sandra"}],"citation-key":"moironMicroevolutionaryResponseSpring2024","container-title":"Evolution Letters","container-title-short":"Evolution Letters","DOI":"10.1093/evlett/qrad014","ISSN":"2056-3744","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"page":"8-17","source":"Silverchair","title":"Micro-evolutionary response of spring migration timing in a wild seabird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/evlett/qrad014","volume":"8"},{"id":"moironMicroevolutionaryResponseSpring2024a","abstract":"In the context of rapid climate change, phenological advance is a key adaptation for which evidence is accumulating across taxa.

We observed a strong phenotypic advance of 9.3 days in arrival date, of which c. 5% was accounted for by an advance in breeding values. The Breeder’s equation and Robertson’s Secondary Theorem of Selection predicted qualitatively similar evolutionary responses to selection, and these theoretical predictions were largely consistent with our estimated genetic pattern. Overall, our study provides rare evidence for micro-evolution underlying (part of) an adaptive response to climate change in the wild, and illustrates how a combination of adaptive micro-evolution and phenotypic plasticity facilitated a shift towards earlier spring migration in this free-living population of common terns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Moiron","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Teplitsky","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Haest","given":"Birgen"},{"family":"Charmantier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Bouwhuis","given":"Sandra"}],"citation-key":"moironMicroevolutionaryResponseSpring2024a","container-title":"Evolution Letters","DOI":"10.1093/evlett/qrad014","ISSN":"2056-3744","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,14]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"8-17","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Micro-evolutionary response of spring migration timing in a wild seabird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/8/1/8/7150359","volume":"8"},{"id":"mollerAnalysisInterpretationLongTerm2004","abstract":"This chapter discusses potential problems inherent to the interpretation of long-term data and, in particular, how these might serve as an explanation of heterogeneity in documented responses to climate change.

The chapter presents a number of methodological considerations. These include questions of which phenological and climatic variable to use, the effects of differences in capture probability on estimates of phenotypic variables, and questions about representativeness of the data collected. It also discusses ways to distinguish between change in phenotype due to phenotypic plasticity and genetic change.

Commonlystudied interacting phenotypes include aggression, courtship, and communication. More extreme examples of interacting phenotypes-traits that exist exclusively as a product of interactions-include social dominance, intraspecific competitive ability, and mating systems, We adopt a quantitative genetic approach to assess genetic influences on interacting phenotypes. We partition genetic and environmental effects so that traits in conspecifics that influence the expression of interacting phenotypes are a component of the environment. When the trait having the effect is heritable, the environmental influence arising from the interaction has a genetic basis and can be incorporated as an indirect genetic effect. However, because it has a genetic basis, this environmental component can evolve. Therefore, to consider the evolution of interacting phenotypes we simultaneously consider changes in the direct genetic contributions to a trait (as a standard quantitative genetic approach would evaluate) as well as changes in the environmental (indirect genetic) contribution to the phenotype, We then explore the ramifications of this model of inheritance on the evolution of interacting phenotypes. The relative rate of evolution in interacting phenotypes can be quite different from that predicted by a standard quantitative genetic analysis. Phenotypic evolution is greatly enhanced or inhibited depending on the nature of the direct and indirect genetic effects. Further, unlike most models of phenotypic evolution, a lack of variation in direct genetic effects does not preclude evolution if there is genetic variance in the indirect genetic contributions. The available empirical evidence regarding the evolution of behavior expressed in interactions, although limited, supports the predictions of our model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Allen J."},{"family":"Brodie","given":"Edmund D."},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Jason B."}],"citation-key":"mooreINTERACTINGPHENOTYPESEVOLUTIONARY1997","container-title":"Evolution","container-title-short":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb01458.x","ISSN":"0014-3820, 1558-5646","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1352-1362","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"INTERACTING PHENOTYPES AND THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS: I.

However, predictions are only valid if all factors causal for trait-fitness covariance are measured. Although this requirement will rarely (if ever) be met in practice, it can be avoided by applying Robertson’s secondary theorem of selection (STS). The STS predicts evolution by directly estimating the genetic basis of trait-fitness covariation without any explicit model of selection. Here we apply the BE and STS to four morphological traits measured in Soay sheep (Ovis aries) from St. Kilda. Despite apparently positive selection on heritable size traits, sheep are not getting larger. However, although the BE predicts increasing size, the STS does not, which is a discrepancy that suggests unmeasured factors are upwardly biasing our estimates of selection on phenotype. We suggest this is likely to be a general issue, and that wider application of the STS could offer at least a partial resolution to the common discrepancy between naive expectations and observed trait dynamics in natural populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Morrissey","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Parker","given":"Darren J."},{"family":"Korsten","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Pemberton","given":"Josephine M."},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E.B."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Alastair J."}],"citation-key":"morrisseyPredictionAdaptiveEvolution2012","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01632.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"2399-2410","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Prediction of Adaptive Evolution: Empirical Application of the Secondary Theorem of Selection and Comparison to the Breeder’s Equation","title-short":"The Prediction of Adaptive Evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01632.x","volume":"66"},{"id":"moskatCanCommonCuckoos2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Moskát","given":"Csaba"},{"family":"Elek","given":"Zoltán"},{"family":"Bán","given":"Miklós"},{"family":"Geltsch","given":"Nikoletta"},{"family":"Hauber","given":"Márk E."}],"citation-key":"moskatCanCommonCuckoos2017","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.02.013","ISSN":"00033472","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4]]},"language":"en","page":"253-260","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Can common cuckoos discriminate between neighbours and strangers by their calls?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347217300507","volume":"126"},{"id":"MothersLegacyStrength","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,26]]},"citation-key":"MothersLegacyStrength","title":"A mother’s legacy: the strength of maternal effects in animal populations - Moore - 2019 - Ecology Letters - Wiley Online Library","type":"webpage","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13351"},{"id":"muffRewritingResultsSections2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Muff","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Nilsen","given":"Erlend B."},{"family":"O’Hara","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Nater","given":"Chloé R."}],"citation-key":"muffRewritingResultsSections2022","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.tree.2021.10.009","ISSN":"0169-5347","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"English","page":"203-210","PMID":"34799145","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"www.cell.com","title":"Rewriting results sections in the language of evidence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(21)00284-6","volume":"37"},{"id":"mummVocalIndividualityCohesion2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mumm","given":"Christina A.S."},{"family":"Urrutia","given":"Maria C."},{"family":"Knörnschild","given":"Mirjam"}],"citation-key":"mummVocalIndividualityCohesion2014","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.12.005","ISSN":"00033472","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"language":"en","page":"243-252","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Vocal individuality in cohesion calls of giant otters, Pteronura brasiliensis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347213005599","volume":"88"},{"id":"munakataVisualRepresentationWild2001","abstract":"Abstract\n            Visual object representation was studied in free-ranging rhesus monkeys.

Because no organism is infinitely or ideally plastic, theory suggests that there must be limits (for example, the lack of ability to produce an optimal trait) to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, or that plasticity may have inherent significant costs. Yet numerous experimental studies have not detected widespread costs. Explicitly differentiating plasticity costs from phenotype costs, we re-evaluate fundamental questions of the limits to the evolution of plasticity and of generalists vs specialists. We advocate for the view that relaxed selection and variable selection intensities are likely more important constraints to the evolution of plasticity than the costs of plasticity. Some forms of plasticity, such as learning, may be inherently costly. In addition, we examine opportunities to offset costs of phenotypes through ontogeny, amelioration of phenotypic costs across environments, and the condition-dependent hypothesis. We propose avenues of further inquiry in the limits of plasticity using new and classic methods of ecological parameterization, phylogenetics and omics in the context of answering questions on the constraints of plasticity. Given plasticity’s key role in coping with environmental change, approaches spanning the spectrum from applied to basic will greatly enrich our understanding of the evolution of plasticity and resolve our understanding of limits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Murren","given":"C.

We presented a wooden dummy of the European sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), an extremely dangerous predator, and its visual modifications (chimeras), changing the beak or head to be non-threatening (those of a pigeon – Columba livia f. domestica). We showed that the differences between ‘slow’ and ‘fast explorers’ are not very distinct, but that ‘slow explorers’ generally tended to be more cautious in the presence of an unmodified sparrowhawk dummy, while the ‘fast explorers’ tended to observe the dummy. On the contrary, ‘slow explorers’ tended to treat both chimaeras (and the pigeon dummy as well) as less-threatening than ‘fast explorers’. Since ‘slow explorers’ are usually considered to be more sensitive to environmental cues, it came as no surprise that most of them correctly assessed the unmodified sparrowhawk dummy as threatening, while they probably subjected the chimeras to a detailed inspection and were not confused by the presence of sparrowhawk features and assessed them as non-threatening.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Nácarová","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Veselý","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Roman"}],"citation-key":"nacarovaEffectExploratoryBehaviour2018","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2018.03.021","ISSN":"0376-6357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"89-95","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Effect of the exploratory behaviour on a bird’s ability to categorize a predator","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635717304916","volume":"151"},{"id":"nacarovaEffectExploratoryBehaviour2018a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Nácarová","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Veselý","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Roman"}],"citation-key":"nacarovaEffectExploratoryBehaviour2018a","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2018.03.021","ISSN":"03766357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"language":"en","page":"89-95","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of the exploratory behaviour on a bird’s ability to categorize a predator","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376635717304916","volume":"151"},{"id":"nacarovaResearchCognitiveAbilities","author":[{"family":"Nácarová","given":"Mgr Jana"}],"citation-key":"nacarovaResearchCognitiveAbilities","language":"en","page":"116","source":"Zotero","title":"Research on cognitive abilities in untrained birds","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"nacarovaResearchCognitiveAbilities2017","author":[{"family":"Nácarová","given":"Mgr Jana"}],"citation-key":"nacarovaResearchCognitiveAbilities2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"116","source":"Zotero","title":"Research on cognitive abilities in untrained birds","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"nagendraOppositeTrendsResponse2002","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagendra","given":"Harini"}],"citation-key":"nagendraOppositeTrendsResponse2002","container-title":"Applied Geography","container-title-short":"Applied Geography","DOI":"10.1016/S0143-6228(02)00002-4","ISSN":"01436228","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4]]},"language":"en","page":"175-186","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Opposite trends in response for the Shannon and Simpson indices of landscape diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0143622802000024","volume":"22"},{"id":"nakaderaReceiptSeminalFluid2014","abstract":"Mating partners often have conflicting interests when copulating [1, 2, 3]. One of the major agents affecting female mating partners is seminal fluid, transferred along with sperm.

The latter potentially have a unique target to exploit for the sperm donor’s own benefit: the male function of their mating partners [7, 8]. Here we show that, in the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, receipt of specific SFPs reduces both sperm transfer and paternity success in a subsequent insemination event. Lowering investment in the mating partner’s male function constitutes a novel role for SFPs. This demonstrates for the first time that hermaphrodites alter their mates’ male as well as female reproductive output [6].

The vertical transmission rate of wHecCI was nearly 100%, and that of wHecFem was c. 80%. The wHecCI densities were 103–104-fold higher than the wHecFem densities. In most tissues, the wHecCI densities were signiﬁcantly higher in offspring of single-infected mothers than in offspring of double-infected mothers. In offspring of double-infected mothers, however, the wHecCI densities were not affected by the presence of wHecFem, suggesting a lack of interaction between the wHecCI and wHecFem densities.

To do so, they (SHJ) sequentially trained human participants with six different visual categorization tasks that varied in structural complexity. Humans’ exceptionally strong performance on one of these tasks (Type 2, organized around XOR relations) could not be solely explained by structural complexity, and has since been considered the hallmark of rule-use in these tasks. In the present project, we concurrently trained pigeons on all six SHJ tasks. Our results revealed that the structural complexity of the tasks was highly correlated with group-level performance. Nevertheless, we observed notable individual differences in performance. Two extensions of a prominent categorization model, ALCOVE (Kruschke, 1992), suggested that disparities in the discriminability of the dimensions used to construct the experimental stimuli could account for these differences. Overall, our pigeons’ generally weak performance on the Type 2 task provides no evidence of rule-use on the SHJ tasks. Pigeons thus join monkeys in the contingent of species that solve these categorization tasks solely on the basis of the physical properties of the training stimuli.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Navarro","given":"Victor M."},{"family":"Jani","given":"Ridhi"},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"navarroPigeonCategoryLearning2019","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition","DOI":"10.1037/xan0000198","ISSN":"2329-8464, 2329-8456","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"language":"en","page":"174-184","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pigeon category learning: Revisiting the Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961) tasks.","title-short":"Pigeon category learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xan0000198","volume":"45"},{"id":"negriFeminizingWolbachiaZyginidia2006","abstract":"Zyginidia pullula is a grass-dwelling leafhopper characterized by a bisexual reproduction mode.

The complete removal of W. pipientis after tetracycline treatment of morphologically normal females, and the consequent re-appearance of males in the brood, permitted us to connect the feminizing effect with the presence of the bacterium.

Unilateral electrolytic brain lesions were made in adult male canaries whose son had been previously recorded and analysed on a sound spectrograph. After severral days of postoperative recording, the birds were sacrificed and their brains processed histologically for degeneration staining with the Fink-Heimer technique. Although large lesions in the neostriatum and rostral hyperstriatum had no effect on song, severe song deficits followed damage to a discrete large-celled area in the caudal hyperstriatum ventrale (HVc). Degenerating fibers were traced from this region to two other discrete nuclei in the forebrain: one in the parolfactory lobe (area X, a teardrop-shaped small-celled nucleus) and a round large-celled nucleus in the archistriatum (RA). Unilateral lesions of X had no effect on song; lesions of RA, however, caused severe song deficits. Degenerating fibers from RA joined the occipitomesencephalic tract and had widespread ipsilateral projections to the thalamus, nucleus intercollicularis of the midbrain, reticular formation, and medulla. It is of particular interest that direct connections were found onto the cells of the motor nucleus innervating the syrinx, the organ of song production. Unilateral lesions of n. intercollicularis (previously implicated in the control of vocal behavior) had little effect on song. One bilateral lesion of HVc resulted in permanent (9 months) and complete elimination of the audible components of song, although the bird assumed the posture and movements typical of song. Preliminary data suggest that lesions of the left hemisphere result in greater deficits than lesions of the right one. This finding is consistent with earlier reports that the left syrinx controls the majority of song components. Results reported here suggest a localization of vocal control in the canary brain with an overlying left hemispheric dominance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nottebohm","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Stokes","given":"Tegner M."},{"family":"Leonard","given":"Christiana M."}],"citation-key":"nottebohmCentralControlSong1976","container-title":"Journal of Comparative Neurology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.901650405","ISSN":"1096-9861","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1976"]]},"language":"en","page":"457-486","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Central control of song in the canary, Serinus canarius","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.901650405","volume":"165"},{"id":"novakovaObjectCategorizationWild2017","abstract":"The object categorization is only scarcely studied using untrained wild ranging animals and relevant stimuli.

This dummy was designed to be dismantled into three parts and rearranged with the head in the correct position, in the middle or at the bottom of the dummy.

We tested whether the parents of the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio) recognize the dummies of the common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), which is a potential predator of large chicks or fledglings, as a threat in case when their body parts are scrambled. The kestrel dummy was presented with the head at the top, in the middle, and at the bottom of the body. We showed that the shrikes did not consider dummies of a kestrel with an inappropriately placed head as a threat to the nest and attacked it equally scarcely as the harmless control. These results support the theory of recognition by components, presuming that the mutual position of body parts is essential for appropriate recognition of the object. When the body parts were scrambled, most of shrikes were not able to identify the kestrel in such an object despite all local features (eye, beak, colouration, and claws) being present. Nevertheless, shrikes did not consider the scrambled dummies as completely harmless, because they fed their chicks in their presence significantly less often than in the presence of harmless control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Nováková","given":"Nela"},{"family":"Veselý","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Roman"}],"citation-key":"novakovaObjectCategorizationWildranging2020","container-title":"Animal Cognition","container-title-short":"Anim Cogn","DOI":"10.1007/s10071-019-01329-3","ISSN":"1435-9448, 1435-9456","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","page":"203-213","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Object categorization by wild-ranging birds in nest defence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10071-019-01329-3","volume":"23"},{"id":"nowickiHowBirdsSing1988","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowicki","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Marler","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"nowickiHowBirdsSing1988","container-title":"Music Perception","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"page":"391-426","title":"How do birds sing ?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://watermark.silverchair.com/40285408.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlUwggJRBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJCMIICPgIBADCCAjcGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM69kmRGSAQleUHhXMAgEQgIICCOhLFSQKxP3it2uyDIEW2zN6U2fOw79iugrkWy6CmZhBjwAXAsb0IlSp2NIfhOndeM_bZ9X9T0n3xi-6D1Xym3FR6urgfJRgR4LsbfJBfa3RWnEeATH2tt6_d--OmAPOgrr49GNLAqLyiKc2Sug54CgOZcaU-CoMTEZKyyiEVbCTXNHJtj_YedH3o4ghu7O6X5ePWjT4fWQm6Q6Jrlr2VKfm9sbzNY0LfCFz2f85pTO-uiPQ44Pb2-kAL9r3RoLqEfyO1kH20CdQgckw_EPC1-hW7s_1o5hja1dZG6Z7dNmglRrpfPDXzAf9L1zo409nqecmfQQD9nBMuh9806ocoMFJzDSwA3Q0ajw7geOQdGSreKnGSZu0pxaJ698VMOQ73Qxhle2-OGBiTWQi25a_wi7hpl9yY9idVlQNNGElL51Fua_7MrpTl5dOqq8AiGbBvEqx1mKBCmlEa7JbrS4kPaBKuo4Iek4SBlvqYVUwuA9BhkiVTMXnknkHR3keo-egDCducpn_NffoAMfPuqlMaT9-WR0qvtoCKzvwXUkjrfvlDpT3B5743uKLxR4JcWTGN41xeILFXcBIZAIOB1qLg9yZjnICwilDyiznRjDt0Siq5jj4OGtIUQX2tCHxtazBbOZl_LS-M08LXpgVeN7ucV91xBh_QGNx6J4_TDKGsIeD2Tw5oi4wXZc","volume":"5"},{"id":"oconnellVertebrateMesolimbicReward2011","abstract":"All animals evaluate the salience of external stimuli and integrate them with internal physiological information into adaptive behavior. Natural and sexual selection impinge on these processes, yet our understanding of behavioral decision-making mechanisms and their evolution is still very limited. Insights from mammals indicate that two neural circuits are of crucial importance in this context: the social behavior network and the mesolimbic reward system. Here we review evidence from neurochemical, tract-tracing, developmental, and functional lesion/stimulation studies that delineates homology relationships for most of the nodes of these two circuits across the five major vertebrate lineages: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and teleost fish. We provide for the first time a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two neural circuits and conclude that they were already present in early vertebrates.

Yearly variation in growth conditions could thus result in morphological and quality differences between cohorts. In this study, we investigated the effect of small differences in the dietary protein content of captive ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) during their ﬁrst 8 wk posthatching. An experimental increase of the proportion of dietary protein during the ﬁrst 3 wk of life accelerated growth, whereas a similar manipulation during the following 5 wk had only a limited effect. Compensatory growth during the postexperimental period equalized the size of chicks from different experimental treatments. However, a difference in tarsus length resulting from experimental treatment during the ﬁrst 3 wk remained into adulthood. Furthermore, the protein content of the diet during the ﬁrst 3 wk had an effect on the degree of ﬂuctuating asymmetry in tarsus length, suggesting persistent effects on the quality of birds. The results of this study may explain size differences between cohorts that exist in pheasants and may also provide a link between the use of pesticides in agriculture and population effects on pheasants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ohlsson","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Henrik G."}],"citation-key":"ohlssonEarlyNutritionCauses2001","container-title":"Physiological and Biochemical Zoology","container-title-short":"Physiological and Biochemical Zoology","DOI":"10.1086/319657","ISSN":"1522-2152, 1537-5293","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",3]]},"language":"en","page":"212-218","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Early Nutrition Causes Persistent Effects on Pheasant Morphology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/319657","volume":"74"},{"id":"OriginSpreadInnovations","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"citation-key":"OriginSpreadInnovations","title":"The origin and spread of innovations in starlings - ScienceDirect","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www-sciencedirect-com.passerelle.univ-rennes1.fr/science/article/pii/S0003347208000250"},{"id":"OrnamentColourSelection","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"citation-key":"OrnamentColourSelection","title":"Ornament colour selection, visual contrast and the shape of colour preference functions in great bowerbirds, Chlamydera nuchalis - ScienceDirect","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www-sciencedirect-com.passerelle.univ-rennes1.fr/science/article/pii/S0003347206003162"},{"id":"osullivanEvolutionaryStasisHeritable2019","abstract":"Comparing observed versus theoretically expected evolutionary responses is important for our understanding of the evolutionary process, and for assessing how species may cope with anthropogenic change. Here, we document directional selection for larger female size in Atlantic salmon, using pedigree-derived estimates of lifetime reproductive success as a fitness measure. We show the trait is heritable and, thus, capable of responding to selection. The Breeder's Equation, which predicts microevolution as the product of phenotypic selection and heritability, predicted evolution of larger size. This was at odds, however, with the observed lack of either phenotypic or genetic temporal trends in body size, a so-called “paradox of stasis.” To investigate this paradox, we estimated the additive genetic covariance between trait and fitness, which provides a prediction of evolutionary change according to Robertson's secondary theorem of selection (STS) that is unbiased by missing variables. The STS prediction was consistent with the observed stasis. Decomposition of phenotypic selection gradients into genetic and environmental components revealed a potential upward bias, implying unmeasured factors that covary with trait and fitness. These results showcase the power of pedigreed, wild population studies—which have largely been limited to birds and mammals—to study evolutionary processes on contemporary timescales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Sullivan","given":"Ronan James"},{"family":"Aykanat","given":"Tutku"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Kane","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Poole","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Rogan","given":"Ger"},{"family":"Prodöhl","given":"Paulo A."},{"family":"Primmer","given":"Craig R."},{"family":"McGinnity","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Reed","given":"Thomas Eric"}],"citation-key":"osullivanEvolutionaryStasisHeritable2019","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.5274","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Authors.

We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses prior to hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change had comparable contributions to the observed dramatic increase in population growth.

To facilitate the inclusion of imperfect detection of individuals in such studies, we develop a method to estimate additive genetic variance and assess heritability for binary traits such as survival, using capture–recapture (CR) data. Our approach combines mixed-effects CR models with a threshold model to incorporate discrete data in a standard ‘animal model’ approach. We employ Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in a Bayesian framework to estimate model parameters. We illustrate our approach using data from a wild population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and present the first estimate of heritability of adult survival in the wild. In agreement with the prediction that selection should deplete additive genetic variance in fitness, we found that survival had low heritability. Because the detection process is incorporated, capture–recapture animal models (CRAM) provide unbiased quantitative genetics analyses of longitudinal data collected in the wild.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Papaïx","given":"J."},{"family":"Cubaynes","given":"S."},{"family":"Buoro","given":"M."},{"family":"Charmantier","given":"A."},{"family":"Perret","given":"P."},{"family":"Gimenez","given":"O."}],"citation-key":"papaixCombiningCaptureRecapture2010","container-title":"Journal of Evolutionary Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02079.x","ISSN":"1420-9101","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"2176-2184","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Combining capture–recapture data and pedigree information to assess heritability of demographic parameters in the wild","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02079.x","volume":"23"},{"id":"parkPerceptionDegradedVocalizations1986","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Dooling","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"parkPerceptionDegradedVocalizations1986","container-title":"Animal Learning & Behavior","container-title-short":"Animal Learning & Behavior","DOI":"10.3758/BF03200079","ISSN":"0090-4996, 1532-5830","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986",12]]},"language":"en","page":"359-364","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perception of degraded vocalizations by budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/BF03200079","volume":"14"},{"id":"parkPerceptionDegradedVocalizations1986a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Dooling","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"parkPerceptionDegradedVocalizations1986a","container-title":"Animal Learning & Behavior","container-title-short":"Animal Learning & Behavior","DOI":"10.3758/BF03200079","ISSN":"0090-4996, 1532-5830","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986",12]]},"language":"en","page":"359-364","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perception of degraded vocalizations by budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/BF03200079","volume":"14"},{"id":"parkPerceptionDegradedVocalizations1986b","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Dooling","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"parkPerceptionDegradedVocalizations1986b","container-title":"Animal Learning & Behavior","container-title-short":"Animal Learning & Behavior","DOI":"10.3758/BF03200079","ISSN":"0090-4996, 1532-5830","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986",12]]},"language":"en","page":"359-364","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perception of degraded vocalizations by budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/BF03200079","volume":"14"},{"id":"parkPerceptionSpeciesSpecificContact1985","author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Dooling","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"parkPerceptionSpeciesSpecificContact1985","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]},"title":"Perception of Species-Specific Contact Calls by Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus)","type":"document"},{"id":"parmesanEcologicalEvolutionaryResponses2006","abstract":"Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups.

This can be due to variation in the various traits that might affect sperm competitive ability, which itself depends on both genetic and environmental factors, as well as on genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI). Seminal fluid is a major component of the male ejaculate that is often expected to mediate sperm competition, where different genotypes can differ in their seminal fluid expression as a response to different levels of sperm competition (i.e. exhibit GEI). We therefore here focussed on testing for GEI in expression of two recently identified seminal fluid transcripts, suckless-1 and suckless-2, which potentially modulate sperm competitive ability in the simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano via their effects on manipulating post-mating partner behaviour and ultimately the fate of transferred ejaculates. In addition, we sought to test for GEI in sperm competitive ability in a standardized sperm competition (P1 and P2) assay, to investigate the relationship between natural variation in the expression of these seminal fluid transcripts generated through GEI and relative paternity success. We found GEI for the expression level of suckless-1 and suckless-2, as well as for sperm competitive ability. Moreover, we found a positive relation between the expression of suckless-1 and relative paternity success (P1).

Because doing so would attract unwanted attention from predators and competitors, animals that have congregated around food are only expected to vocalize if the benefits (e.g. recruiting or announcing themselves to allies, deterring competitors, warning of danger, begging for a meal, appeasing a dominant) outweigh these costs. Here we demonstrate that wild crows change the quality of their calls depending on the amount of food present. The crows near a large food windfall gave shorter calls compared to their vocalizations in food's absence, and playback of these short calls only prompted a mild aggressive response from listening crows. In contrast, the calls given before the appearance of food were longer, and their playback elicited behaviours from the listening crows associated with aggression and territory defence. These findings suggest that crows avoid giving territorial calls near an exploitable food resource and vocalize for other reasons. Taken together, this study provides insights on how the caller's current context can shift the costs and benefits of vocalizing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Pendergraft","given":"LomaJohn T."},{"family":"Marzluff","given":"John M."}],"citation-key":"pendergraftFussingFoodFactors2019","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.01.024","ISSN":"0003-3472","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"39-57","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Fussing over food: factors affecting the vocalizations American crows utter around food","title-short":"Fussing over food","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347219300363","volume":"150"},{"id":"penry-williamsOddityEffectDrives2018","abstract":"The tendency of predators to preferentially attack phenotypically odd prey in groups (the oddity effect) is a clear example of how predator cognition can impact behaviour and morphology in prey. Through targeting phenotypically odd prey, predators are thought to avoid the cognitive constraints that delay and limit the success of attacks on homogenous prey groups (the confusion effect). In addition to influencing which prey a predator will attack, the confusion and oddity effects would also predict that attacks on odd prey can occur more rapidly than attacking the majority prey type, as odd prey are more easily targeted, but this prediction has yet to be tested. Here, we used kerri tetra fish, Inpaichthys kerri, presented with mixed phenotypic groups of Daphnia dyed red or black to investigate whether odd prey in groups are preferentially attacked and whether these attacks were faster than those on the majority prey type. In agreement with previous work, odd prey were targeted and attacked more often than expected from their frequency in the prey groups, regardless of whether the odd prey was red in a group of black prey or vice versa. However, no difference was found in the time taken to attack odd vs. majority prey items, contrary to our predictions. Our results suggest that the time taken to make an attack is determined by a wider range of factors or is subject to greater variance than the choice of which prey is selectively targeted in a group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Penry‐Williams","given":"Iestyn L."},{"family":"Ioannou","given":"Christos C."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Martin I."}],"citation-key":"penry-williamsOddityEffectDrives2018","container-title":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/eth.12754","ISSN":"1439-0310","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","page":"496-503","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The oddity effect drives prey choice but not necessarily attack time","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eth.12754","volume":"124"},{"id":"penry-williamsOddityEffectDrives2018a","abstract":"The tendency of predators to preferentially attack phenotypically odd prey in groups (the oddity effect) is a clear example of how predator cognition can impact behaviour and morphology in prey.

Interactions between members of the same group were mainly cohesive, which confirms the social nature of this species. Social interactions between marmots from different family groups were rare and agonistic. The rate of social interactions decreased as the season progressed, probably in relation to a shift in allocation of energy to preparation for hibernation. Some cohesive interactions increased just before immergence, when marmots restricted their activity to the main burrow system. Rates of social interactions differed between groups and between individuals. Fewer agonistic acts, more play-fighting, and persistence of play-fighting late in the active season among immatures suggest the influence of an ontogenetic component. The most agonistic of the studied groups included an adult male that had recently immigrated. He focused most of his agonistic acts on three 2-year-old males, of which two dispersed during the season. Social events characteristic of each group, individual variability, and level of familiarity between group members influence the quality of social interactions and the dispersal of immatures.

It is shown that the projection model can be described by a geometric trend model which is superimposed by six cyclical components. In the long run, the population time series can be explained quite well by the sum of only two components, the trend component and one component with explosive cycles of a period of about 24 years. In the very long run, the influence of the cyclical component diminishes, and the series can be solely explained by its geometric trend component, as has been also recognized by Euler and Süßmilch.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pflaumer","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"pflaumerEulerSussmilchsPopulation2019","contributor":[{"family":"Technische Universität Dortmund","given":""},{"family":"Technische Universität Dortmund","given":""}],"DOI":"10.17877/DE290R-20454","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,2]]},"language":"en","publisher":"TU Dortmund","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Euler and Süßmilch’s Population Growth Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/handle/2003/38535"},{"id":"pickDescribingPosteriorDistributions2023","abstract":"Assessing the biological relevance of variance components estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based mixed-effects models is not straightforward. Variance estimates are constrained to be greater than zero and their posterior distributions are often asymmetric. Different measures of central tendency for these distributions can therefore vary widely, and credible intervals cannot overlap zero, making it difficult to assess the size and statistical support for among-group variance. Statistical support is often assessed through visual inspection of the whole posterior distribution and so relies on subjective decisions for interpretation. We use simulations to demonstrate the difficulties of summarizing the posterior distributions of variance estimates from MCMC-based models. We then describe different methods for generating the expected null distribution (i.e. a distribution of effect sizes that would be obtained if there was no among-group variance) that can be used to aid in the interpretation of variance estimates. Through comparing commonly used summary statistics of posterior distributions of variance components, we show that the posterior median is predominantly the least biased. We further show how null distributions can be used to derive a p-value that provides complementary information to the commonly presented measures of central tendency and uncertainty. Finally, we show how these p-values facilitate the implementation of power analyses within an MCMC framework. The use of null distributions for variance components can aid study design and the interpretation of results from MCMC-based models. We hope that this manuscript will make empiricists using mixed models think more carefully about their results, what descriptive statistics they present and what inference they can make.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pick","given":"Joel L."},{"family":"Kasper","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Allegue","given":"Hassen"},{"family":"Dingemanse","given":"Niels J."},{"family":"Dochtermann","given":"Ned A."},{"family":"Laskowski","given":"Kate L."},{"family":"Lima","given":"Marcos R."},{"family":"Schielzeth","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Westneat","given":"David F."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Araya-Ajoy","given":"Yimen G."}],"citation-key":"pickDescribingPosteriorDistributions2023","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.14200","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"2557-2574","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Describing posterior distributions of variance components: Problems and the use of null distributions to aid interpretation","title-short":"Describing posterior distributions of variance components","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.14200","volume":"14"},{"id":"PictureObjectRecognition","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,6]]},"citation-key":"PictureObjectRecognition","title":"Picture object recognition in an American black bear (Ursus americanus) | SpringerLink","type":"webpage","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1011-4"},{"id":"pigeonBiasedEstimationTrends2018","abstract":"Environmental variation can generate life-long similarities among individuals born in the same breeding event, so-called cohort effects. Studies of cohort effects have to account for the potentially confounding effects of current conditions (observation year) and age of individuals. However, estimation of such models is hampered by inherent collinearity, as age is the difference between observation year (period) and cohort year. The difficulties of separating linear trends in any of the three variables in Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models are the subject of ongoing debate in social sciences and medicine but have remained unnoticed in ecology. After reviewing the use of APC models, we investigate the consequences of model specification on the estimation of cohort effects, using both simulated data and empirical data from a long-term individual-based study of reindeer in Svalbard. We demonstrate that APC models are highly sensitive to the model's treatment of age, period and cohort, which may generate spurious temporal trends in cohort effects. Avoiding grouping ages and using environmental covariates believed to be drivers of temporal variation reduces the APC identification problem. Nonetheless, ecologists should use caution, given that the specification issues in APC models may have substantial impacts on estimated effect sizes and therefore conclusions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pigeon","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Loe","given":"Leif Egil"},{"family":"Albon","given":"Steve D."},{"family":"Bonenfant","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Elston","given":"David A."},{"family":"Justin Irvine","given":"R."},{"family":"Ropstad","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Veiberg","given":"Vebjørn"},{"family":"Stien","given":"Audun"}],"citation-key":"pigeonBiasedEstimationTrends2018","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2545","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"2675-2680","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Biased estimation of trends in cohort effects: the problems with age-period-cohort models in ecology","title-short":"Biased estimation of trends in cohort effects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2545","volume":"99"},{"id":"pigeonIntenseSelectiveHunting2016","abstract":"The potential for selective harvests to induce rapid evolutionary change is an important question for conservation and evolutionary biology, with numerous biological, social and economic implications. We analyze 39 years of phenotypic data on horn size in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) subject to intense trophy hunting for 23 years, after which harvests nearly ceased. Our analyses revealed a significant decline in genetic value for horn length of rams, consistent with an evolutionary response to artificial selection on this trait. The probability that the observed change in male horn length was due solely to drift is 9.9%. Female horn length and male horn base, traits genetically correlated to the trait under selection, showed weak declining trends. There was no temporal trend in genetic value for female horn base circumference, a trait not directly targeted by selective hunting and not genetically correlated with male horn length. The decline in genetic value for male horn length stopped, but was not reversed, when hunting pressure was drastically reduced. Our analysis provides support for the contention that selective hunting led to a reduction in horn length through evolutionary change. It also confirms that after artificial selection stops, recovery through natural selection is slow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Pigeon","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Festa-Bianchet","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Coltman","given":"David W."},{"family":"Pelletier","given":"Fanie"}],"citation-key":"pigeonIntenseSelectiveHunting2016","container-title":"Evolutionary Applications","DOI":"10.1111/eva.12358","ISSN":"1752-4571","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"521-530","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Intense selective hunting leads to artificial evolution in horn size","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eva.12358","volume":"9"},{"id":"PigeonsIdentifyIndividual","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"citation-key":"PigeonsIdentifyIndividual","title":"Pigeons identify individual humans but show no sign of recognizing them in photographs - ScienceDirect","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635709002320"},{"id":"PigeonsIdentifyIndividuala","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"citation-key":"PigeonsIdentifyIndividuala","title":"Pigeons identify individual humans but show no sign of recognizing them in photographs - ScienceDirect","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635709002320"},{"id":"PigeonsShowSameDifferent","citation-key":"PigeonsShowSameDifferent","title":"Pigeons Show Same-Different Conceptualization After Training With Complex Visual Stimuli","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"PIIS0764446901013944Elsevier","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,5]]},"citation-key":"PIIS0764446901013944Elsevier","DOI":"10.1016/S0764-4469(01)01394-4","language":"en","title":"PII: S0764-4469(01)01394-4 | Elsevier Enhanced Reader","title-short":"PII","type":"webpage","URL":"https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0764446901013944?token=0B14F882A86BF62D6A0CF2762E0B8E2C840CD2CB53E346973703D631085663E38EEE8AC24678C1F6F21E8F1763A4E3F3&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20210505131839"},{"id":"pikaUseReferentialGestures2011","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pika","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Bugnyar","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"pikaUseReferentialGestures2011","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms1567","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","page":"560","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The use of referential gestures in ravens (Corvus corax) in the wild","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1567","volume":"2"},{"id":"pikaUseReferentialGestures2011a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pika","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Bugnyar","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"pikaUseReferentialGestures2011a","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms1567","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","page":"560","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The use of referential gestures in ravens (Corvus corax) in the wild","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1567","volume":"2"},{"id":"pikaUseReferentialGestures2011b","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pika","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Bugnyar","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"pikaUseReferentialGestures2011b","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms1567","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","page":"560","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The use of referential gestures in ravens (Corvus corax) in the wild","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1567","volume":"2"},{"id":"pitchersEvolutionaryRatesMultivariate2014","abstract":"A fundamental question in evolutionary biology is the relative importance of selection and genetic architecture in determining evolutionary rates. Adaptive evolution can be described by the multivariate breeders' equation (), which predicts evolutionary change for a suite of phenotypic traits () as a product of directional selection acting on them (β) and the genetic variance–covariance matrix for those traits (G). Despite being empirically challenging to estimate, there are enough published estimates of G and β to allow for synthesis of general patterns across species. We use published estimates to test the hypotheses that there are systematic differences in the rate of evolution among trait types, and that these differences are, in part, due to genetic architecture. We find some evidence that sexually selected traits exhibit faster rates of evolution compared with life-history or morphological traits. This difference does not appear to be related to stronger selection on sexually selected traits. Using numerous proposed approaches to quantifying the shape, size and structure of G, we examine how these parameters relate to one another, and how they vary among taxonomic and trait groupings. Despite considerable variation, they do not explain the observed differences in evolutionary rates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pitchers","given":"William"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Jason B."},{"family":"Tregenza","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Hunt","given":"John"},{"family":"Dworkin","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"pitchersEvolutionaryRatesMultivariate2014","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2013.0252","issue":"1649","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,19]]},"page":"20130252","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Evolutionary rates for multivariate traits: the role of selection and genetic variation","title-short":"Evolutionary rates for multivariate traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2013.0252","volume":"369"},{"id":"plardInfluencesClimaticSocial2021","abstract":"In an environment with limited resources, parents may trade-off the number of offspring produced against offspring mass. To maximize fitness under unpredictable environments, females must not only maximize mean annual reproductive success but also minimize between-year variation in reproductive success. Thus, preferred strategies of maternal allocation might be to maximize the mass of their offspring or to produce a number of offspring of variable body masses. Many social species have evolved in variable and unpredictable environments where only the social environment can be predicted. If mothers seem to alter their total reproductive allocation to offspring depending on their social environment, how the total expenditure is allocated between the different offspring is still unknown. Here, we analysed how climatic and social environments influence strategies of maternal allocation and how these strategies impact pup first-year survival in a wild population of Alpine marmots monitored between 1990 and 2016. We found that females acted as income breeders using resources immediately available for reproduction. Our results showed that the proportion of maternal mass allocated to offspring varied mainly with litter size. However, how maternal allocation is shared between pups depended on climatic and social environments. In general, mothers tended to have litters of greater average mass and small variability in favourable social environments or when resources are abundant and lighter average pup mass but high variability in unfavourable social environments or when resources are scarce. This variable allocation could correspond to dynamic bet-hedging such that mothers influence the variance of pup mass within the litter in response to poor current environmental conditions. Our analysis of first-year survival showed that females should maximize the body mass of their young whatever the conditions will be because pups of higher mass have higher survival, regardless of environmental conditions. When resources are scarce, this strategy might not be achievable for all pups so that mothers produced variable pups. In large litters, this strategy increased first-year survival. Because pup variability affects parental fitness, differential allocation between pups of the same litter could have large consequences on fitness and thus on reproductive strategies of social species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Plard","given":"Floriane"},{"family":"Chamiot-clerc","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"}],"citation-key":"plardInfluencesClimaticSocial2021","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.13380","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"471-482","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Influences of climatic and social environment on variable maternal allocation among offspring in Alpine marmots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13380","volume":"90"},{"id":"plissonRuleBasedApproach","abstract":"Lemmatization is the process of finding the normalized form of a word.

We illustrate how transient eﬀects with a classical measurement error structure may bias estimates of heritability, selection gradients, and the response to selection of a continuous trait, and propose suitable strategies to obtain error-corrected estimates. Unbiased estimates can be retrieved with repeated measurements, given that they were taken at an appropriate temporal scale. However, the fact that repeated measurements were previously used to isolate permanent environmental (instead of transient) eﬀects requires that we rethink their information content. We propose a distinction into “short-term” and “long-term” repeats, whereas the former capture transient variability, and the latter the permanent eﬀects. A simulation study illustrates how the inclusion of appropriate variance components in the models helps retrieving unbiased estimates of all quantities of interest.

Here, we offer 10 recommendations to amplify the discoverability of studies in search engines and databases. Particularly, we argue that the strategic use and placement of key terms in the title, abstract and keyword sections can boost indexing and appeal. By surveying 230 journals in ecology and evolutionary biology, we found that current author guidelines may unintentionally limit article findability. Our survey of 5323 studies revealed that authors frequently exhaust abstract word limits—particularly those capped under 250 words. This suggests that current guidelines may be overly restrictive and not optimized to increase the dissemination and discoverability of digital publications. Additionally, 92% of studies used redundant keywords in the title or abstract, undermining optimal indexing in databases. We encourage adopting structured abstracts to maximize the incorporation of key terms in titles, abstracts and keywords. In addition, we encourage the relaxation of abstract and keyword limitations in journals with strict guidelines, and the inclusion of multilingual abstracts to broaden global accessibility. These recommendations to editors are designed to improve article engagement and facilitate evidence synthesis, thereby aligning scientific publishing with the modern needs of academic research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Pottier","given":"Patrice"},{"family":"Lagisz","given":"Malgorzata"},{"family":"Burke","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Drobniak","given":"Szymon M."},{"family":"Downing","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Macartney","given":"Erin L."},{"family":"Martinig","given":"April Robin"},{"family":"Mizuno","given":"Ayumi"},{"family":"Morrison","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Pollo","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Ricolfi","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Tam","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Coralie"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yefeng"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Shinichi"}],"citation-key":"pottierTitleAbstractKeywords2024","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2024.1222","issue":"2027","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,31]]},"page":"20241222","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Title, abstract and keywords: a practical guide to maximize the visibility and impact of academic papers","title-short":"Title, abstract and keywords","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2024.1222","volume":"291"},{"id":"pougnaultExperimentalTestsMeasuring2021","abstract":"Attention is defined as the ability to process selectively one aspect of the environment over others and is at the core of all cognitive processes such as learning, memorization, and categorization. Thus, evaluating and comparing attentional characteristics between individuals and according to situations is an important aspect of cognitive studies. Recent studies showed the interest of analyzing spontaneous attention in standardized situations, but data are still scarce, especially for songbirds. The present study adapted three tests of attention (towards visual non-social, visual social, and auditory stimuli) as tools for future comparative research in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), a species that is well known to present individual variations in social learning or engagement. Our results reveal that attentional characteristics (glances versus gazes) vary according to the stimulus broadcasted: more gazes towards unusual visual stimuli and species-specific auditory stimuli and more glances towards species-specific visual stimuli and hetero-specific auditory stimuli. This study revealing individual variations shows that these tests constitute a very useful and easy-to-use tool for evaluating spontaneous individual attentional characteristics and their modulation by a variety of factors. Our results also indicate that attentional skills are not a uniform concept and depend upon the modality and the stimulus type.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pougnault","given":"Loïc"},{"family":"Cousillas","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Heyraud","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Ludwig"},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"Martine"},{"family":"Henry","given":"Laurence"}],"citation-key":"pougnaultExperimentalTestsMeasuring2021","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani11082233","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","page":"2233","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Experimental Tests for Measuring Individual Attentional Characteristics in Songbirds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/8/2233","volume":"11"},{"id":"PraatDoingPhonetics","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,7]]},"citation-key":"PraatDoingPhonetics","title":"Praat: doing Phonetics by Computer","type":"webpage","URL":"http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/"},{"id":"prendevilleEffectsVirusPlant2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Prendeville","given":"Holly R."},{"family":"Tenhumberg","given":"Brigitte"},{"family":"Pilson","given":"Diana"}],"citation-key":"prendevilleEffectsVirusPlant2014","collection-title":"Wiley Online Library","container-title":"New Phytologist","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.12730","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1346-1356","title":"Effects of virus on plant fecundity and population dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.12730","volume":"202"},{"id":"PsycNETRecordDisplay","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"citation-key":"PsycNETRecordDisplay","title":"PsycNET Record Display - PsycNET","type":"webpage","URL":"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-06578-020"},{"id":"pujolMissingResponseSelection2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pujol","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Blanchet","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Charmantier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Danchin","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Facon","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Marrot","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Roux","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Scotti","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Teplitsky","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Thomson","given":"Caroline E."},{"family":"Winney","given":"Isabel"}],"citation-key":"pujolMissingResponseSelection2018","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.tree.2018.02.007","ISSN":"01695347","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"language":"en","page":"337-346","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Missing Response to Selection in the Wild","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534718300399","volume":"33"},{"id":"pujolMissingResponseSelection2018a","abstract":"Although there are many examples of contemporary directional selection, evidence for responses to selection that match predictions are often missing in quantitative genetic studies of wild populations.

These biological mechanisms can accelerate or constrain this response. These mechanisms are generally studied independently but might act simultaneously.

Here, five starlings were tested to examine whether they experienced the Ebbinghaus–Titchener illusion. Across two experiments using an absolute target circle size discrimination, the size, similarity, distance, and number of the surrounding flankers were manipulated. The results suggest that this passerine species exhibits behavior inconsistent with the perception of the illusion, neither in a human-like fashion nor, as suggested by the first experiment, a reversed illusion. Instead, the typical training used to investigate this illusion caused the starlings to learn to integrate the irrelevant flankers into their decision process in a manner that precludes the study of illusory perception. The resulting discriminative behavior might best be described using a template-matching account. While illusion perception by animals remains an important comparative question, it requires additional validation to confirm the exact mechanisms of any illusory reports.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Qadri","given":"Muhammad A.

Examining acquisition, steady-state performance, and the effects of diminishing global coherence, it was found that the perception of Glass patterns by five starlings differed from human perception and corresponded to that established with pigeons.

I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher’s average-excess equation, Robertson’s secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder’s equation, and Fisher’s fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacriﬁcing perfect accuracy.

We demonstrate that these advances are adaptive for some species, but imperfect as evidenced by the observed consistent selection for earlier timing.

The barnacle population in the high intertidal zone tends to show longterm stability due to a low incidence of both predation and interspecific competition. Wave exposure, desiccation and intraspecific competition are more important factors affecting abundance and size distribution in this zone (Menge, 1976). In the low intertidal zone, barnacle predation by the dogwhelk,\n              Nucella lapillus\n              (L.) is intense (Menge, 1976) and both the adults and larvae are smaller than in the high intertidal zone (Barnes, 1953).

Although domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are on the brink to become one of the model animals in animal psychology, their categorization abilities are unknown. This is probably largely due to the absence of an adequate method for testing dogs’ ability to discriminate between large sets of pictures in the absence of human cueing. Here we present a computer-automated touch-screen testing procedure, which enabled us to test visual discrimination in dogs while social cueing was ruled out. Using a simultaneous discrimination procedure, we first trained dogs (N = 4) to differentiate between a set of dog pictures (N = 40) and an equally large set of landscape pictures. All subjects learned to discriminate between the two sets and showed successful transfer to novel pictures. Interestingly, presentation of pictures providing contradictive information (novel dog pictures mounted on familiar landscape pictures) did not disrupt performance, which suggests that the dogs made use of a category-based response rule with classification being coupled to category-relevant features (of the dog) rather than to item-specific features (of the background). We conclude that dogs are able to classify photographs of natural stimuli by means of a perceptual response rule using a newly established touch-screen procedure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Range","given":"Friederike"},{"family":"Aust","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Steurer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Ludwig"}],"citation-key":"rangeVisualCategorizationNatural2008","container-title":"Animal Cognition","container-title-short":"Anim Cogn","DOI":"10.1007/s10071-007-0123-2","ISSN":"1435-9456","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"339-347","source":"Springer Link","title":"Visual categorization of natural stimuli by domestic dogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-007-0123-2","volume":"11"},{"id":"ratinaudApplicationMethodeALCESTE2012","abstract":"We propose an analysis of the entire 251,287 telegrams of the “CableGate”.

We investigated the potential effect of rising temperatures on the body size of a common toad (Bufo bufo L.) population in southern England between 1983 and 2020. The body length (SVL; in millimetres) and body mass (in grams) of 15 550 males and 4004 females arriving at their breeding pond for the first time were recorded. Toad body condition was estimated using a scaled body mass index (SMI). Over the study period, the mean annual temperature increased by ~1.3 °C, whereas the mean SVL and SMI of both sexes declined. Multiple regression analysis showed that female and male SMI were negatively correlated with increases in mean summer temperatures, with females also being impacted minimally by mean winter rainfall. Mean body size (SVL) was positively correlated with toad abundance over the period between emergence as toadlets and arrival at the pond to breed for the first time. Common toads exhibited phenotypic plasticity in response to warming environmental conditions, resulting in a reduction in SMI and subsequent reductions in SVL and overall egg production, which occurred over a period of 10 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Reading","given":"Christopher J"},{"family":"Jofré","given":"Gabriela M"}],"citation-key":"readingDecliningCommonToad2021","container-title":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","DOI":"10.1093/biolinnean/blab101","ISSN":"0024-4066, 1095-8312","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","page":"577-586","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Declining common toad body size correlated with climate warming","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/134/3/577/6363923","volume":"134"},{"id":"realeHeritabilityBodyMass1999","abstract":"Heritabilities (h2) of body mass at different ages and seasons were estimated using offspring–mother regression and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods for bighorn sheep on Ram Mountain, Alberta.

The evolutionary origin of syntactic abilities has been investigated by testing pattern perception capacities in nonhuman animals. New World primates can respond spontaneously to structural changes in acoustic sequences and songbirds can learn to discriminate between various patterns in operant tasks. However, there is no conclusive evidence that songbirds respond spontaneously to structural changes in patterns without reinforcement or training. In this study, we tested pattern perception capacities of common ravens, Corvus corax, in a habituation–discrimination playback experiment. To enhance stimulus salience, call recordings of male and female ravens were used as acoustic elements, combined to create artificial territorial displays as target patterns. We habituated captive territorial raven pairs to displays following a particular pattern and subsequently exposed them to several test and control playbacks. Subjects spent more time visually orienting towards the loudspeaker in the discrimination phase when they heard structurally novel call combinations, violating the pattern presented during habituation. This demonstrates that songbirds, much like primates, can be sensitive to structural changes in auditory patterns and respond to them spontaneously, without training.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Reber","given":"Stephan A."},{"family":"Boeckle","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Szipl","given":"Georgine"},{"family":"Janisch","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Bugnyar","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Fitch","given":"W.

Contrary to basic expectation, individual coefficients of inbreeding ( f) were recently hypothesized to be intrinsically correlated across parents and offspring in structured populations, potentially creating an additional source of phenotypic resemblance in traits that show inbreeding depression. To test this hypothesis, we used individual-based simulations to quantify the parent–offspring correlations in f arising under random mating in populations of different size, immigration rate, and mating system. Parent–offspring correlations in f were typically positive (median r≈ 0.2–0.4) in relatively small and isolated populations. Relatively inbred parents therefore produced relatively inbred offspring on average, although the magnitude of this effect varied considerably among replicate populations. Correlations were higher given more generations of random mating, greater variance in reproductive success, polygynous rather than monogamous mating, and for midparent–offspring rather than parent–offspring relationships. Furthermore, f was also positively correlated across half-siblings, and closer relatives had more similar inbreeding coefficients across entire generations. Such intrinsic resemblance in f among relatives could provide an additional genetic benefit of mate choice and bias quantitative genetic analyses that do not account for correlated inbreeding depression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Reid","given":"Jane M."},{"family":"Keller","given":"Lukas F."}],"citation-key":"reidCorrelatedInbreedingRelatives2010","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00865.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"973-985","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Correlated Inbreeding Among Relatives: Occurrence, Magnitude, and Implications","title-short":"Correlated Inbreeding Among Relatives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00865.x","volume":"64"},{"id":"reinertMethodeClassificationDescendante","author":[{"family":"Reinert","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"reinertMethodeClassificationDescendante","language":"fr","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"Une méthode de classification descendante hiérarchique : application à l'analyse lexicale par contexte","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"reinertMethodeClassificationDescendante1983","author":[{"family":"Reinert","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"reinertMethodeClassificationDescendante1983","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"language":"fr","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"Une méthode de classification descendante hiérarchique : application à l'analyse lexicale par contexte","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"reinertMethodeClassificationEnonces1990","author":[{"family":"Reinert","given":"Max"}],"citation-key":"reinertMethodeClassificationEnonces1990","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"language":"fr","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Une méthode de classification des énoncés d'un corpus présentée à l'aide d'une application","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"reinertMondesLexicauxStabilises2008","abstract":"The main tools used in the “ALCESTE” method were conceived around thirty years ago.

Species-specific life histories should condition the way climate influences population dynamics, particularly those that are associated with environmental constraints, such as lifestyles like hibernation and sociality. However, the influence of lifestyle in the response of organisms to climate change remains poorly understood. Based on a 23-year longitudinal study on Alpine marmots, we investigated how their lifestyle, characterized by a long hibernation and a high degree of sociality, interacts with the ongoing climate change to shape temporal variation in age-specific survival. As generally reported in other hibernating species, we expected survival of Alpine marmots to be affected by the continuous lengthening of the growing season of plants more than by changes in winter conditions. We found, however, that Alpine marmots displayed lower juvenile survival over time. Colder winters associated with a thinner snow layer lowered juvenile survival, which in turn was associated with a decrease in the relative number of helpers in groups the following years, and therefore lowered the chances of over-winter survival of juveniles born in the most recent years. Our results provide evidence that constraints on life-history traits associated with hibernation and sociality caused juvenile survival to decrease over time, which might prevent Alpine marmots coping successfully with climate change.","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.12507","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"3","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.12507","page":"761-773","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Socially mediated effects of climate change decrease survival of hibernating Alpine marmots","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.12507","volume":"85","author":[{"family":"Rézouki","given":"Célia"},{"family":"Tafani","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Loison","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Jean-Michel"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Bonenfant","given":"Christophe"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"citation-key":"rezoukiSociallyMediatedEffects2016","library":"My Library","citekey":"rezoukiSociallyMediatedEffects2016"},{"id":"ribotDoesRingSpecies2009","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribot","given":"Raoul F.H."},{"family":"Berg","given":"Mathew L."},{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Katherine L."},{"family":"Komdeur","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Joseph","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Andrew T.D."}],"citation-key":"ribotDoesRingSpecies2009","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.10.029","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",3]]},"language":"en","page":"581-593","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Does the ring species concept predict vocal variation in the crimson rosella, Platycercus elegans, complex?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347208005186","volume":"77"},{"id":"ribotFruitfulUseBioacoustic2011","abstract":"Birds cause considerable damage to horticultural crops in Australia each year.

A typical feature of such zones is the presence of clinal variation in multiple traits. The nature of these traits and the concordance among clines are expected to influence whether and how quickly speciation will proceed. Learned signals, such as vocalizations in species having vocal learning (e.g. humans, many birds, bats and cetaceans), can exhibit rapid change and may accelerate reproductive isolation between populations. Therefore, particularly strong concordance among clines in learned signals and population genetic structure may be expected, even among continuous populations in the early stages of speciation. However, empirical evidence for this pattern is often limited because differences in vocalisations between populations are driven by habitat differences or have evolved in allopatry. We tested for this pattern in a unique system where we may be able to separate effects of habitat and evolutionary history. We studied geographic variation in the vocalizations of the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) parrot species complex. Parrots are well known for their life-long vocal learning and cognitive abilities. We analysed contact calls across a ca 1300 km transect encompassing populations that differed in neutral genetic markers and plumage colour. We found steep clinal changes in two acoustic variables (fundamental frequency and peak frequency position). The positions of the two clines in vocal traits were concordant with a steep cline in microsatellite-based genetic variation, but were discordant with the steep clines in mtDNA, plumage and habitat. Our study provides new evidence that vocal variation, in a species with vocal learning, can coincide with areas of restricted gene flow across geographically continuous populations. Our results suggest that traits that evolve culturally can be strongly associated with reduced gene flow between populations, and therefore may promote speciation, even in the absence of other barriers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribot","given":"Raoul F.

Using a newly assembled and taxonomically expansive database, we analyzed the relationships between extinction risk and body mass (27,647 species) and between extinction risk and range size (21,294 species) for vertebrates across six main classes. We found that the probability of being threatened was positively and significantly related to body mass for birds, cartilaginous fishes, and mammals. Bimodal relationships were evident for amphibians, reptiles, and bony fishes. Most importantly, a bimodal relationship was found across all vertebrates such that extinction risk changes around a body mass breakpoint of 0.035 kg, indicating that the lightest and heaviest vertebrates have elevated extinction risk. We also found range size to be an important predictor of the probability of being threatened, with strong negative relationships across nearly all taxa. A review of the drivers of extinction risk revealed that the heaviest vertebrates are most threatened by direct killing by humans. By contrast, the lightest vertebrates are most threatened by habitat loss and modification stemming especially from pollution, agricultural cropping, and logging. Our results offer insight into halting the ongoing wave of vertebrate extinctions by revealing the vulnerability of large and small taxa, and identifying size-specific threats. Moreover, they indicate that, without intervention, anthropogenic activities will soon precipitate a double truncation of the size distribution of the world’s vertebrates, fundamentally reordering the structure of life on our planet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ripple","given":"William J."},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Newsome","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wirsing","given":"Aaron J."},{"family":"McCauley","given":"Douglas J."}],"citation-key":"rippleExtinctionRiskMost2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1702078114","issue":"40","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,3]]},"page":"10678-10683","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Extinction risk is most acute for the world’s largest and smallest vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1702078114","volume":"114"},{"id":"ristauCognitiveEthologyEssays2014","abstract":"This collection of essays was written by former students, associates, admirers, critics and friends of Donald R.

The right hemisphere is likely to be specialized for processing attention for details and the left hemisphere for categorization of stimuli. Thus attentional processes actually may underlie lateralization. In the present study, we hypothesized that the attentional state of horses could be reflected in the lateralization of brain responses. We used i) a recently developed attention test to measure horses’ visual attentional responses towards a standardized stimulus and ii) a recently developed portable EEG telemetric tool to measure brain responses. A particular emphasis was given to the types of waves (EEG power profile) and their side of production when horses were either attentive towards a visual stimulus or quiet standing. The results confirmed that a higher attentional state is associated with a higher proportion of gamma waves. There was moreover an interaction between the attentional state, the hemisphere and the EEG profile: attention towards the visual stimulus was associated with a significant increase of gamma wave proportion in the right hemisphere while “inattention” was associated with more alpha and beta waves in the left hemisphere. These first results are highly promising and contribute to the large debate on functional lateralization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rochais","given":"C."},{"family":"Sébilleau","given":"M."},{"family":"Menoret","given":"M."},{"family":"Oger","given":"M."},{"family":"Henry","given":"S."},{"family":"Hausberger","given":"M."},{"family":"Cousillas","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"rochaisAttentionalStateBrain2018","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-28334-9","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,5]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","page":"10153","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Attentional state and brain processes: state-dependent lateralization of EEG profiles in horses","title-short":"Attentional state and brain processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28334-9","volume":"8"},{"id":"rochaisLowerAttentionDaily2016","abstract":"Chronic pain is thought to affect patients’ cognitive functioning, including attention.

This study investigates attentional engagement of domestic horses by comparing observations in a home setting and evaluations of vertebral disorders. We found that lower attentional engagement and the level of back disorders were correlated. Two different evaluation techniques of the state of horses’ spines gave similar results. We suggest that novel animal models would prove useful for identifying spontaneous behaviours indicative of chronic pain. We suggest that more ethological studies in human patients’ home environments would help to improve our understanding of the processes involved.

Such sign reversals are difficult to interpret in a biologically meaningful way, and could lead to erroneous evolutionary inferences if the true mechanism underlying the sign reversal differed from the proposed mechanism. Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that sign reversal occurs over a wide range of parameter values common in the biological sciences. Further, as a case-in-point, we review the literature on brain size evolution; a field that explores how ecological traits relate to the evolution of relative brain size (brain size relative to body size).

In birds, the left hemisphere is specialised to categorise stimuli and to discriminate preferred categories from distracting stimuli (e.g., food from an array of inedible objects), whereas the right hemisphere responds to small diﬀerences between stimuli, controls social behaviour, detects predators and controls attack, fear and escape responses. In this paper, we concentrate on visual lateralization and the eﬀect of light exposure of the avian embryo on the development of lateralization, and we consider its role in the welfare of birds after hatching. Findings suggest that light-exposure during incubation has a general positive eﬀect on post-hatching behaviour, likely because it facilitates control of behaviour by the left hemisphere, which can suppress fear and other distress behaviour controlled by the right hemisphere. In this context, particular attention needs to be paid to the inﬂuence of corticosterone, a stress hormone, on lateralization. Welfare of animals in captivity, as is well known, has two cornerstones: enrichment and reduction of stress. What is less well-known is the link between the inﬂuence of experience on brain lateralization and its consequent positive or negative outcomes on behaviour. We conclude that the welfare of birds may be diminished by failure to expose the developing embryos to light but we also recognise that more research on the association between lateralization and welfare is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,6]]},"author":[{"literal":"Rogers"},{"literal":"Kaplan"}],"citation-key":"rogersDoesFunctionalLateralization2019a","container-title":"Symmetry","container-title-short":"Symmetry","DOI":"10.3390/sym11081043","ISSN":"2073-8994","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,13]]},"language":"en","page":"1043","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Does Functional Lateralization in Birds Have any Implications for Their Welfare?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/8/1043","volume":"11"},{"id":"rogersEvolutionHemisphericSpecialization2000","abstract":"Lateralization of the brain appeared early in evolution and many of its features appear to have been retained, possibly even in humans. We now have a considerable amount of information on the different forms of lateralization in a number of species, and the commonalities of these are discussed, but there has been relatively little investigation of the advantages of being lateralized. This article reports new findings on the differences between lateralized and nonlateralized chicks. The lateralized chicks were exposed to light for 24 h on day 19 of incubation, a treatment known to lead to lateralization of a number of visually guided responses, and the nonlateralized chicks were incubated in the dark. When they were feeding, the lateralized chicks were found to detect a stimulus resembling a raptor with shorter latency than nonlateralized chicks. This difference was not a nonspecific effect caused by the light-exposed chicks being more distressed by the stimulus. Instead, it appears to be a genuine advantage conferred by having a lateralized brain.

Similar effects were found whether rats were assigned to differential experience at weaning (25 days of age), as young adults (105 days) or as adults (285 days). Enriched early experience improved performance on several tests of learning. Cerebral results of experience in an enriched environment are similar to results of formal training. Enriched experience and training appear to evoke the same cascade of neurochemical events in causing plastic changes in brain.

As selection is generally expected to be strongest under stressful conditions, understanding how the expression of genetic variation changes across stressful and benign environmental conditions is crucial for predicting the rate of adaptive change. Although theory generally predicts increased genetic variation under stress, previous syntheses of the field have found limited support for this notion. These studies have focused on heritability, which is dependent on other environmentally sensitive, but nongenetic, sources of variation. Here, we aim to complement these studies with a meta-analysis in which we examine changes in coefficient of variation (CV) in maternal, genetic, and residual variances across stressful and benign conditions. Confirming previous analyses, we did not find any clear direction in how heritability changes across stressful and benign conditions. However, when analyzing CV, we found higher genetic and residual variance under highly stressful conditions in life-history traits but not in morphological traits. Our findings are of broad significance to contemporary evolution suggesting that rapid evolutionary adaptive response may be mediated by increased evolutionary potential in stressed populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rowiński","given":"Piotr K."},{"family":"Rogell","given":"Björn"}],"citation-key":"rowinskiEnvironmentalStressCorrelates2017a","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/evo.13201","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 The Author(s).

In the context of climate change, there is evidence that some bat species are increasing their body size via phenotypic responses to higher temperatures at maternity roosts. To test the generality of this response, we conducted a >20-year study examining body size changes in 15 bat species in Italy, analysing data from 4393 individual bats captured since 1995. In addition to examining the temporal effect, we considered the potential influence of sexual dimorphism and, where relevant, included latitude and altitude as potential drivers of body size change. Contrary to initial predictions of a widespread increase in size, our findings challenge this assumption, revealing a nuanced interplay of factors contributing to the complexity of bat body size dynamics. Specifically, only three species (Myotis daubentonii, Nyctalus leisleri, and Pipistrellus pygmaeus) out of the 15 exhibited a discernible increase in body size over the studied period, prompting a reassessment of bats as reliable indicators of climate change based on alterations in body size. Our investigation into influencing factors highlighted the significance of temperature-related variables, with latitude and altitude emerging as crucial drivers. In some cases, this mirrored patterns consistent with Bergmann's rule, revealing larger bats recorded at progressively higher latitudes (Plecotus auritus, Myotis mystacinus, and Miniopterus schreibersii) or altitudes (Pipistrellus kuhlii). We also observed a clear sexual dimorphism effect in most species, with females consistently larger than males. The observed increase in size over time in three species suggests the occurrence of phenotypic plasticity, raising questions about potential long-term selective pressures on larger individuals. The unresolved question of whether temperature-related changes in body size reflect microevolutionary processes or phenotypic plastic responses adds further complexity to our understanding of body size patterns in bats over time and space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Russo","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Gareth"},{"family":"Martinoli","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Preatoni","given":"Damiano G."},{"family":"Spada","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Pereswiet-Soltan","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Cistrone","given":"Luca"}],"citation-key":"russoClimateChangingAre2024","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.10872","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"e10872","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Climate is changing, are European bats too?

Thirty minutes later both chicks were presented with a similar, dry, bead to determine whether learning had taken place. Experiment 1 showed that chicks were able to learn, by observation only, not to peck the bead when it had been coated in MeA at training. Experiment 2 demonstrated a role of lateralization in performing the task; specifically, male observer chicks trained binocularly but tested monocularly had a poorer performance in this task with the left hemisphere than with the right. In experiment 3, we both trained and tested chicks monocularly. This time there was no difference between left-eyed and right-eyed chicks, suggesting a spontaneous bias for encoding relevant information available at training in the right hemisphere. In conclusion, chicks are able to avoid pecking just by observing a conspecific. The social learning appears to be lateralized to the right hemisphere in male chicks, females showing no bias in lateralization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Salva","given":"Orsola Rosa"},{"family":"Daisley","given":"Jonathan Niall"},{"family":"Regolin","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Vallortigara","given":"Giorgio"}],"citation-key":"salvaLateralizationSocialLearning2009","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.06.021","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"847-856","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Lateralization of social learning in the domestic chick, Gallus gallus domesticus: learning to avoid","title-short":"Lateralization of social learning in the domestic chick, Gallus gallus domesticus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347209002899","volume":"78"},{"id":"sanmiguelAttentionCaptureNovel2010","abstract":"Unexpected sounds have been shown to capture attention, triggering an orienting response.

We estimated natural and social selection gradients on exploration, docility, and body mass, and their contribution to selection differentials, in a wild eastern chipmunk population (Tamias striatus). We applied trait-based multiple regression models derived from classical phenotypic selection analyses, which allowed us to include several social partners (i.e., neighbors). We detected social selection gradients on female docility and male body mass, indicating that female with docile neighbors and males with large neighbors had lower fitness. In both sexes, social selection gradients varied with the season. However, we found no phenotypic assortment or disassortment for the studied traits. Social selection gradients, therefore, did not contribute to total selection differentials, and natural selection alone could drive phenotypic changes.

However, few studies address whether birds respond differently to similar male and female calls. This study investigated whether an Australian cockatoo, the Galah (Eolophus roseicapillus), responds differentially to three types of loud calls (Double Chet, Chechet and Chewp) commonly produced by both sexes. I played back male and female vocalisations to wild Galahs in Canberra, Australia, and recorded vocal and approach responses. Galahs responded differently to at least one call type, with birds approaching male Double Chets more closely but vocalising more to female Double Chets. Males were more likely than females to vocalise to Double Chets and Chechets, regardless of stimulus sex. These results suggest that males may have to expend more effort than females in forming afﬁliative relationships. Although males and females exhibited different vocal behaviour, paired males and females tended to approach stimuli together, which may indicate that coordination of movement, rather than coordination of vocal behaviour, is important in maintaining the pair-bond. These experiments show that even when the sexes share a repertoire, the sender and receiver sex may inﬂuence the nature of a vocal interaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Scarl","given":"Judith C."}],"citation-key":"scarlMaleFemaleContact2009","container-title":"Emu - Austral Ornithology","container-title-short":"Emu - Austral Ornithology","DOI":"10.1071/MU08067","ISSN":"0158-4197, 1448-5540","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"language":"en","page":"281-287","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Male and female contact calls differentially influence behaviour in a cockatoo, the Galah ( <i>Eolophus roseicapillus</i> )","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1071/MU08067","volume":"109"},{"id":"scarlSEXDIFFERENCESVOCAL2009","author":[{"family":"Scarl","given":"Judith"}],"citation-key":"scarlSEXDIFFERENCESVOCAL2009","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"SEX DIFFERENCES AND VOCAL FLEXIBILITY IN WILD PARROT COMMUNICATION","type":"thesis"},{"id":"scharerBiggerTestesWork2004","abstract":"Evolutionary theory predicts that more resources are allocated to sperm production when sperm competition is high. This prediction is supported by both comparative and experimental data on static measures of male allocation, such as testis and ejaculate size. However, resource allocation is a dynamic process, and it is therefore important to evaluate if the static measures reflect this. Such an evaluation has to our knowledge never been done. Immunocytochemical labelling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) allows visualisation of cells in S-phase. BrdU becomes incorporated into cells if, and only if, they are actively undergoing DNA duplication, which is a dynamic process. The number of BrdU-positive cells in the testis can hence serve as a dynamic measure of male allocation, i.e. testicular activity. We evaluate the relationship between testis size and testicular activity in the marine flatworm Macrostomum sp. In a previous study, we showed that testis size is phenotypically plastic in this species, and that worms make larger testes when they are raised in larger groups. We use this plasticity to experimentally produce variation in testis size, and demonstrate that larger testes are associated with higher testicular activity. Moreover, testis size and testicular activity were related linearly. We have thus, for the first time, shown that testis size is a good measure of resource allocation to the male function. Moreover, increased testicular activity is probably one of the first steps in the upregulation of sperm production. It is thus expected that testicular activity is a more sensitive measure of short-term variation in male allocation than the commonly used static measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Schärer","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Ladurner","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Rieger","given":"Reinhard M."}],"citation-key":"scharerBiggerTestesWork2004","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","container-title-short":"Behav Ecol Sociobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s00265-004-0802-9","ISSN":"1432-0762","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"420-425","source":"Springer Link","title":"Bigger testes do work more: experimental evidence that testis size reflects testicular cell proliferation activity in the marine invertebrate, the free-living flatworm Macrostomum sp.","title-short":"Bigger testes do work more","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-004-0802-9","volume":"56"},{"id":"scharerEvolutionDontBe2014","abstract":"Simultaneous hermaphrodites are both male and female, which could lead to conflicts between partners over optimal investment to the two sex functions.

Such variation, which can have environmental or genetic sources, can generate a positive relationship between male and female investment and can thus obscure the trade-off. In this study on the hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum sp. we tried to control for budget effects by restricting food availability in a standardized way and by using an inbred line. We then manipulated mating group size in a two-way design (two group sizes × two enclosure sizes) in order to induce phenotypic variation in male allocation, and expected to find an opposing correlated response in female allocation.

Understanding the causes, consequences, and potential mitigation of these changes will be essential as we move forward into a warming world.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue p.\n              10.1126/science.aaf7671\n            \n          , \n            \n              BACKGROUND\n              Climate change impacts have now been documented across every ecosystem on Earth, despite an average warming of only ~1°C so far. Here, we describe the full range and scale of climate change effects on global biodiversity that have been observed in natural systems. To do this, we identify a set of core ecological processes (32 in terrestrial and 31 each in marine and freshwater ecosystems) that underpin ecosystem functioning and support services to people. Of the 94 processes considered, 82% show evidence of impact from climate change in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples of observed impacts from meta-analyses and case studies go beyond well-established shifts in species ranges and changes to phenology and population dynamics to include disruptions that scale from the gene to the ecosystem.\n            \n            \n              ADVANCES\n              Species are undergoing evolutionary adaptation to temperature extremes, and climate change has substantial impacts on species physiology that include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex ratios in species with temperature-dependent sex determination, and increased metabolic costs of living in a warmer world. These physiological adjustments have observable impacts on morphology, with many species in both aquatic and terrestrial systems shrinking in body size because large surface-to-volume ratios are generally favored under warmer conditions. Other morphological changes include reductions in melanism to improve thermoregulation, and altered wing and bill length in birds.\n              Broader-scale responses to climate change include changes in the phenology, abundance, and distribution of species. Temperate plants are budding and flowering earlier in spring and later in autumn. Comparable adjustments have been observed in marine and freshwater fish spawning events and in the timing of seasonal migrations of animals worldwide. Changes in the abundance and age structure of populations have also been observed, with widespread evidence of range expansion in warm-adapted species and range contraction in cold-adapted species. As a by-product of species redistributions, novel community interactions have emerged. Tropical and boreal species are increasingly incorporated into temperate and polar communities, respectively, and when possible, lowland species are increasingly assimilating into mountain communities. Multiplicative impacts from gene to community levels scale up to produce ecological regime shifts, in which one ecosystem state shifts to an alternative state.\n            \n            \n              OUTLOOK\n              The many observed impacts of climate change at different levels of biological organization point toward an increasingly unpredictable future for humans. Reduced genetic diversity in crops, inconsistent crop yields, decreased productivity in fisheries from reduced body size, and decreased fruit yields from fewer winter chill events threaten food security. Changes in the distribution of disease vectors alongside the emergence of novel pathogens and pests are a direct threat to human health as well as to crops, timber, and livestock resources. Humanity depends on intact, functioning ecosystems for a range of goods and services. Enhanced understanding of the observed impacts of climate change on core ecological processes is an essential first step to adapting to them and mitigating their influence on biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.\n              \n                \n                  Climate change impacts on ecological processes in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems.\n                  Impacts can be measured on multiple processes at different levels of biological organization within ecosystems. In total, 82% of 94 ecological processes show evidence of being affected by climate change. Within levels of organization, the percentage of processes impacted varies from 60% for genetics to 100% for species distribution.\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Most ecological processes now show responses to anthropogenic climate change. In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheffers","given":"Brett R."},{"family":"De Meester","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Bridge","given":"Tom C.

Empirical studies of wild populations often ignore IGEs especially among unrelated individuals, probably due to data limitations. This is problematic because IGEs can crucially affect estimates of heritable variation and subsequently influence the predicted evolutionary change. We here present a quantitative genetic analysis of biparental care in a natural bird population using a genetic pedigree. For both sexes, the conventionally calculated repeatability (15% in the female trait and 19% in the male trait) was lower than the total heritable variation including IGEs (24% in the female trait, and 25% in the male trait). These estimates of total heritable variation was also larger compared to conventionally calculated heritability (13% in both sexes), suggesting that parental care can evolve through social selection. Furthermore, we detected statistically significant genetic covariance between direct genetic effects, and between IGEs and direct genetic effects. Our work showcases how IGEs can represent substantial and important hidden heritable variance and highlights the importance of considering IGEs for theoretical models of parental care for ecology and evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Dugdale","given":"Hannah L."},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Sparks","given":"Alexandra M."},{"family":"Burke","given":"Terry"}],"citation-key":"schroederSocialGeneticEffects2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"language":"en","license":"CC-By Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International","publisher":"EcoEvoRxiv","source":"ecoevorxiv.org","title":"Social genetic effects (IGE) and genetic intra- and intersexual genetic correlation contribute to the total heritable variance in parental care","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/4513/"},{"id":"schwingVocalRepertoireNew2012","abstract":"Abstract.

The controls had significantly higher growth rates than the experimentals and fledged significantly earlier. At the end of treatment, controls were significantly larger than experimentals in body mass, tarsus length, and length of the third primary. After treatment ended, when all birds were receiving the same diet, both groups showed a recession in body mass, but the amount of mass lost was significantly greater in the controls. Consequently the difference in body mass between the treatment groups was much reduced after the period of weight recession. As adults, the controls were significantly larger than experimentals in a principal component measure of size that combined six post‐mortem bone measurements. Controls and experimentals did not differ in the number of fault bars in tail feathers grown in part during the period of nutritional manipulation, nor did they differ in the degree of asymmetry in bone measurements.

Along with shifts in phenology and distributions, declining body size has been purported to be one of the three universal responses to anthropogenic climate change, yet few studies have been conducted at the spatial and temporal scales appropriate to test this claim. Here, we report that in response to warming of terrestrial ecosystems across North America over the past century, small mammals are decreasing in body size. We further estimate that by 2100 (when global temperatures may have risen some 2.5 to 5.5 °C since 1880), the total anthropogenic decline in body mass of these ecologically and economically important species may range from 10 to 21%. Such shifts in body size of the great multitudes of small mammal populations are, in turn, likely to have major impacts on the structural and functional diversity of terrestrial assemblages across the globe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Searing","given":"Katherina B."},{"family":"Lomolino","given":"Mark V."},{"family":"Rozzi","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"searingMeltingClimatesShrink2023","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2310855120","issue":"50","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,12]]},"page":"e2310855120","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Melting climates shrink North American small mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2310855120","volume":"120"},{"id":"seebacherClimateChangeImpacts2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Seebacher","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Post","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"seebacherClimateChangeImpacts2015","container-title":"Climate Change Responses","container-title-short":"Climate Change Responses","DOI":"10.1186/s40665-015-0013-9","ISSN":"2053-7565","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,6]]},"page":"5","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Climate change impacts on animal migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40665-015-0013-9","volume":"2"},{"id":"segerCategoryLearningBrain2010","abstract":"The ability to group items and events into functional categories is a fundamental characteristic of sophisticated thought.

However, experimental studies showing effects of sperm production on mating behaviour and paternity success have so far been scarce, mainly because sperm production is difficult to manipulate directly in animals. Here, we used phenotypic engineering to manipulate sperm-production rate, by employing dose-dependent RNA interference (RNAi) of a spermatogenesis-specific gene, macbol1, in the free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano. We demonstrate (i) that our novel dose-dependent RNAi approach allows us to induce high variability in sperm-production rate; (ii) that a reduced sperm-production rate is associated with a decreased copulation frequency, suggesting conditional adjustment of mating behaviour; and (iii) that both sperm production and copulation frequency are important determinants of paternity success in a competitive situation, as predicted by sperm competition theory.

Some skills are elementary and virtually ubiquitous in the animal kingdom; others are more limited in their taxonomic distribution.

As a result, more complex levels of social cognition indicate greater selective pressures in the past. The presence of each skill can be tested directly through field observations and experiments.

It is only relatively recently, however, that increasing numbers of researchers have begun to investigate individual differences in cognitive ability within species. It has been suggested that cognitive test batteries may provide an ideal tool for this growing research endeavour. In fact, cognitive test batteries have now been used to examine the causes, consequences and underlying structure of cognitive performance within and between many species. In this review, we document the existing attempts to develop cognitive test batteries for non-human animals and review the claims that these studies have made in terms of the structure and evolution of cognition.

Several factors may influence individual performance in a cognitive task, with some being unrelated to the cognitive ability that is the target of the test. It is therefore essential to assess how extraneous factors may affect task performance, particularly for those tasks that are frequently used to quantify individual differences in cognitive ability. The current study therefore measured the performance of wild North Island robins in two tasks commonly used to measure individual differences in avian cognition: a novel motor task and a detour reaching task. The robins’ performance in the motor task was affected by prior experience; individuals that had previously participated in a similar task that required a different motor action pattern outperformed naïve subjects. By contrast, detour reaching performance was influenced by an individual’s body condition, suggesting that energetic state may affect inhibitory control in robins. Designing tasks that limit the influence of past experience and developing means of standardising motivation across animals tested in the wild remain key challenges to improving current measurements of cognitive ability in birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Shaw","given":"Rachael C."}],"citation-key":"shawTestingCognitionWild2017","collection-title":"Individual differences in cognition and personality","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2016.06.004","ISSN":"0376-6357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-36","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Testing cognition in the wild: factors affecting performance and individual consistency in two measures of avian cognition","title-short":"Testing cognition in the wild","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635716301279","volume":"134"},{"id":"sheridanRoleCategoryDensity2019","abstract":"Prior categorization studies have shown that pigeons reliably track features that are relevant to category discrimination.

When videotaped images of female pigeons were presented as stimuli, the display duration by male pigeons was not significantly different from that for the live birds. In contrast, the subjects showed much shorter, or no, displays to the video images of a non-pigeon bird (cockatoo) and an empty chamber. The results suggest that the video images of pigeons contained necessary information to trigger the courtship behaviors. Furthermore, the present study examined which features of the video images were critical for triggering the displays by manipulating the images. Thus, the subjects' behaviors were more vigorous (1) when video images were in motion rather than still, and (2) when the head-only region was visible rather than the body-only region. These results suggest that motion and facial/head characteristics are important features.

Two of these determinants are original to this paper: mass effect, the establishment of species in sites where they cannot be self-maintaining; and ecological equivalency, the coexistence of species with effectively identical niche and habitat requirements. The mode of action and ecological implications of each biological determinant are discussed using a schematic method for measuring alpha (community), beta (differentiation), and gamma (regional) diversities. The importance of mass effects and ecological equivalency to species richess is documented with several types of field data from Israel and California, U.S.A. Floristic richness and, in particular, the richness of floristic transitions, are discussed and interpreted by use of the biological determinants of diversity. Contact transition between distinct floras are rich predominantly because of mass effects. Transitions induced by marked environmental changes are rich because of the combined influences of habitat diversity and mass effects. The rate at which species richness increases with sample area is related to the combined effects of all four biological determinants. This complexity explains the failures of simple species-area models. The relative intensity of each determinant is related to area: niche relations are most important at within-community scales, habitat diversity most important at both within-community and landscape scales, and ecological equivalency most important at regional scales. We suggest that understanding patterns of species diversity will be enhanced by the partitioning of total species richness into the richness caused by each of the four ecologically distinct determinants of diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Shmida","given":"Avi"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Mark V."}],"citation-key":"shmidaBiologicalDeterminantsSpecies1985","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.2307/2845026","ISSN":"0305-0270","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]},"page":"1-20","publisher":"Wiley","source":"JSTOR","title":"Biological Determinants of Species Diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2845026","volume":"12"},{"id":"sidmanConditionalDiscriminationVs1982","abstract":"A subject's performance under a conditional-discrimination procedure defines conditional relations between stimuli: “If A1, then B1; if A2, then B2.” The procedure may also generate matching to sample. If so, the stimuli will be related not only by conditionality, but by equivalence: A1 and B1 will become equivalent members of one stimulus class, A2 and B2 of another. One paradigm for testing whether a conditional-discrimination procedure has generated equivalence relations uses three sets of stimuli, A, B, and C, three stimuli per set. Subjects learn to select Set-B and Set-C comparisons conditionally upon Set-A samples. Having been explicitly taught six sample-comparison relations, A1B1, A1C1, A2B2, A2C2, A3B3, and A3C3, subjects prove immediately capable of matching the B- and C-stimuli; six new relations emerge (B1C1, B2C2, B3C3, C1B1, C2B2, C3B3). The 12 stimulus relations, six taught and six emergent, define the existence of three three-member stimulus classes, A1B1C1, A2B2C2, and A3B3C3. This paradigm was expanded by introducing three more stimuli (Set D), and teaching eight children not only the AB and AC relations but DC relations also—selecting Set-C comparisons conditionally upon Set-D samples. Six of the children proved immediately capable of matching the B- and D-stimuli to each other. By selecting appropriate Set-B comparisons conditionally upon Set-D samples, and Set-D comparisons conditionally upon Set-B samples, they demonstrated the existence of three four-member stimulus classes, A1B1C1D1, A2B2C2D2, and A3B3C3D3. These larger classes were confirmed by the subjects' success with the prerequisite lower-level conditional relations; they were also able to select Set-D comparisons conditionally upon samples from Sets A and C, and to do the BC and CB matching that defined the original three-member classes. Adding the three DC relations therefore generated 12 more, three each in BD, DB, AD, and CD. Enlarging each class by one member brought about a disproportionate increase in the number of emergent relations. Ancillary oral naming tests suggested that the subject's application of the same name to each stimulus was neither necessary nor sufficient to establish classes of equivalent stimuli.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sidman","given":"Murray"},{"family":"Tailby","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"sidmanConditionalDiscriminationVs1982","container-title":"Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1901/jeab.1982.37-5","ISSN":"1938-3711","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982"]]},"language":"en","page":"5-22","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Conditional Discrimination Vs.

With all subjects, a reversal of the contingencies for one pair of stimuli became sufficient to change their responses to all of the other pairs.

Then, all subjects showed conditional discriminations emerging between members of a functional class; given a sample from one class and comparisons from both classes, they selected the comparison that was in the same class as the sample. Next, 2 of the subjects showed that the within-class conditional relations possessed the symmetric and transitive properties of equivalence relations; after having been taught to relate new stimuli to existing class members, the subjects then matched other class members to the new stimuli.

However, for reductions in size to reflect adaptive evolution, directional selection on body size within populations must have become negative, or where already negative, to have become more so, as temperatures increased. To test this hypothesis, we performed traditional and phylogenetic meta-analyses of the association between annual estimates of directional selection on body size from wild populations and annual mean temperatures from 39 longitudinal studies. We found no evidence that warmer environments were associated with selection for smaller size. Instead, selection consistently favoured larger individuals, and was invariant to temperature. These patterns were similar in ectotherms and endotherms. An analysis using year rather than temperature revealed similar patterns, suggesting no evidence that selection has changed over time, and also indicating that the lack of association with annual temperature was not an artefact of choosing an erroneous time window for aggregating the temperature data. Although phenotypic trends in size will be driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, our results suggest little evidence for a necessary ingredient—negative directional selection—for declines in body size to be considered an adaptive evolutionary response to changing selection pressures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Siepielski","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Morrissey","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Carlson","given":"Stephanie M."},{"family":"Francis","given":"Clinton D."},{"family":"Kingsolver","given":"Joel G."},{"family":"Whitney","given":"Kenneth D."},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E.

Non-breeding ravens call at food that is difficult to access, resulting in the attraction of nearby conspecifics. Although callers may benefit from group formation in various ways, we recently found substantial individual variation in food calling. We here explored whether this variation can be partly explained by the social dynamics in raven foraging groups, together with already known effects of age class and sex. Specifically, we expected ravens to respond to the presence or absence of affiliates that could act as cooperative partners in the forthcoming feeding event, that is they should call when other ravens were present but they themselves were alone rather than when they were also in company of an affiliation partner. We observed the vocal behaviour of individually marked wild ravens and, simultaneously, categorized their affiliative behaviour with other ravens in the minutes before experimentally controlled feedings. In line with our prediction, individuals were less likely to produce food-associated calls when they were in close contact with an affiliation partner prior to feeding as compared to when they were alone. Furthermore, sex and age class influenced food calling as females called more often than males and younger birds called more often than adult ravens. In conclusion, these results suggest that ravens attempt to find support from a particular cooperative partner by broadly advertise feeding opportunities via food-associated calls, especially when they have low chances in contest competition due to their age and sex. These findings lend further support to the assumption of raven flocks being structured by social relationships and individual birds flexibly controlling their vocal signalling according to the current flock composition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Sierro","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Loretto","given":"Matthias‐Claudio"},{"family":"Szipl","given":"Georgine"},{"family":"Massen","given":"Jorg J.

Here we used linear mixed models to estimate genetic (co)variances attributable to direct and indirect effects for growth and foliar disease damage in a large pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus. We found significant IGEs for growth and disease damage, which increased with age for growth. The correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects was highly negative for growth, but highly positive for disease damage, consistent with neighbour competition and infection, respectively. IGEs increased heritable variation by 71% for disease damage, but reduced heritable variation by 85% for growth, leaving nonsignificant heritable variation for later age growth. Thus, IGEs are likely to prevent response to selection in growth, despite a considerable ordinary heritability. IGEs change our perspective on the genetic architecture and potential response to selection. Depending on the correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects, IGEs may enhance or diminish the response to natural or artificial selection compared with that predicted from ordinary heritability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"João Costa","dropping-particle":"e"},{"family":"Potts","given":"Brad M."},{"family":"Bijma","given":"Piter"},{"family":"Kerr","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Pilbeam","given":"David J."}],"citation-key":"silvaGeneticControlInteractions2013","container-title":"New Phytologist","DOI":"10.1111/nph.12035","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"631-641","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genetic control of interactions among individuals: contrasting outcomes of indirect genetic effects arising from neighbour disease infection and competition in a forest tree","title-short":"Genetic control of interactions among individuals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.12035","volume":"197"},{"id":"silvaGeneticDiversityfitnessCorrelation2006","abstract":"The relationship between individual genetic diversity and fitness-related traits are poorly understood in the wild. The availability of highly polymorphic molecular markers, such as microsatellites, has made research on this subject more feasible. We used three microsatellite-based measures of genetic diversity, individual heterozygosity H, mean d2 and mean d2outbreeding to test for a relationship between individual genetic diversity and important fitness trait, juvenile survival, in a population of alpine marmots (Marmota marmota), after controlling for the effects of ecological, social and physiological parameters that potentially influence juvenile survival in marmots. Analyses were conducted on 158 juveniles, and revealed a positive association between juvenile survival and genetic diversity measured by mean H. No association was found with mean d2 and with mean d2outbreeding. This suggests a fitness disadvantage to less heterozygous juveniles. The genetic diversity-fitness correlation (GDFC) was somewhat stronger during years with poor environmental conditions (i.e. wet summers). The stressful environmental conditions of this high mountain population might enhance inbreeding depression and make this association between genetic diversity and fitness detectable. Moreover the mating system, allowing extra pair copulation by occasional immigrants, as well as close inbreeding, favours a wide range of individual genetic diversity (mean H ranges from 0.125 to 1), which also may have facilitated the detection of the GDFC. The results further suggest that the observed GDFC is likely to be explained by the “local effect” hypothesis rather than by the “general effect” hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"A.

The “signaling group membership” hypothesis proposes that socially learned calls evolved and are maintained as signals of group membership. However, in fission–fusion societies, individuals can interact in social groups across various social scales. For learned calls to signal group membership over multiple social scales, they must contain information about group membership over each of these scales, a concept termed “hierarchical mapping.” Monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), small parrots native to South America, exhibit vocal mimicry in captivity and fission–fusion social dynamics in the wild. We examined patterns of contact call acoustic similarity in Uruguay to test the hierarchical mapping assumption of the signaling group membership hypothesis. We also asked whether geographic variation patterns matched regional dialects or geographic clines that have been documented in other vocal learning species. We used visual inspection, spectrographic cross-correlation and random forests, a machine learning approach, to evaluate contact call similarity. We compared acoustic similarity across social scales and geographic distance using Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation. We found high similarity within individuals, and low, albeit significant, similarity within groups at the pair, flock and site social scales. Patterns of acoustic similarity over geographic distance did not match mosaic or graded patterns expected in dialectal or clinal variation. Our findings suggest that monk parakeet social interactions rely more heavily upon individual recognition than group membership at higher social scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith-Vidaurre","given":"Grace"},{"family":"Araya-Salas","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Timothy F"}],"citation-key":"smith-vidaurreIndividualSignaturesOutweigh2020","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arz202","editor":[{"family":"Naguib","given":"Marc"}],"ISSN":"1045-2249, 1465-7279","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,20]]},"language":"en","page":"448-458","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Individual signatures outweigh social group identity in contact calls of a communally nesting parrot","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/31/2/448/5680715","volume":"31"},{"id":"smithCategoriesConcepts1981","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Edward E"},{"family":"Medin","given":"Douglas L"}],"citation-key":"smithCategoriesConcepts1981","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","source":"Zotero","title":"Categories and concepts","type":"book","volume":"9"},{"id":"smithCategorizationViewAnimal2016","abstract":"Exemplar, prototype, and rule theory have organized much of the enormous literature on categorization.

This perspective is being extended to study categorization in other vertebrate species, using category tasks that have a one-dimensional, rule-based solution or a two-dimensional, information-integration solution. Humans, macaques, and capuchin monkeys strongly dimensionalize perceptual stimuli and learn rule-based tasks more quickly. In sharp contrast, pigeons learn these two tasks equally quickly. Pigeons represent a cognitive system in which the commitment to dimensional analysis and category rules was not strongly made. Their results may reveal the character of the ancestral vertebrate categorization system from which that of primates emerged.

Because many aspects of an organism's ecology and evolution are influenced by environmental temperature, this suggests temperature mediated changes may be already occurring in natural ecosystems. Using archived mammal trapping and meteorological data, we investigated local changes in climate over the past 8 yr at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in an arid region of New Mexico to determine i) if environmental conditions had altered, ii) if mean body mass of woodrats had changed over this time period, and iii) if the answers to i) and ii) were positive, were the results correlated? Body mass was chosen because it is highly sensitive to temperature and many crucial ecological and evolutionary parameters are affected by it. Our results indicate that winter temperature measures (average cold and minimum), and maximum summer temperature have changed significantly over the past 8 yr. Summer and winter temperatures have both increased by ca 2.5 to 3°C. When compared to long-term means, all years have had significantly warmer than average minimum temperatures. Mean body mass of woodrat populations has also changed significantly over the past 8 yr, and the changes are negatively correlated with both winter and summer temperatures. We predict that additional climatic warming will lead to further decreases in the mean body mass of woodrats at the Sevilleta NWR. Since many important ecological parameters are tightly linked with body mass (e.g. fecundity, dietary strategy, home range, extinction rates, energetic requirements, predation risk, etc.), our results suggest that further climate change may lead to profound alterations in woodrat life history, and indirectly, on the dynamics and Structure of the entire community. This is in addition to any direct effect temperature may have on other plants and animals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Felisa A."},{"family":"Browning","given":"Hillary"},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Ursula L."}],"citation-key":"smithInfluenceClimateChange1998","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00668.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","page":"140-148","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The influence of climate change on the body mass of woodrats Neotoma in an arid region of New Mexico, USA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00668.x","volume":"21"},{"id":"smithInvitationCognitiveScience1995","abstract":"An Invitation to Cognitive Science provides a point of entry intothe vast realm of cognitive science, offering selected examples of issues and theories from many ofits subfields.

The author surveys important category tasks within the categorization literature from the perspective of the optimality of applying prototype and exemplar processes. Formal simulations reveal that organisms will often (not always!) receive more useful signals about category belongingness if they average their exemplar experience into a prototype and use this as the comparative standard for categorization. This survey then provides the theoretical context for considering the evolution of cognitive systems for categorization. In the article’s final sections, the author reviews recent research on the performance of nonhuman primates and humans in the tasks analyzed in the article. Diverse species share operating principles, default commitments, and processing weaknesses in categorization. From these commonalities, it may be possible to infer some properties of the categorization ecology these species generally experienced during cognitive evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"J.

Infected males produced significantly fewer sperm cysts than uninfected males over the first 10 days of adult life, and infected males, under varied mating conditions, had lower fertility compared to uninfected males. This fertility effect was due to neither differences between infected and uninfected males in the transfer and subsequent processing of accessory gland proteins by females nor to the presence of Wolbachia in mature sperm. We found that heat shock, which is known to decrease CI expression, increases sperm production to a greater extent in infected compared to uninfected males, suggesting a possible link between sperm production and heat shock. Given these results, the roles Wolbachia and heat shock play in mediating male gamete production may be important parameters for understanding the dynamics of infection in natural populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Snook","given":"Rhonda R"},{"family":"Cleland","given":"Sophia Y"},{"family":"Wolfner","given":"Mariana F"},{"family":"Karr","given":"Timothy L"}],"citation-key":"snookOffsettingEffectsWolbachia2000","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/genetics/155.1.167","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",5,1]]},"page":"167-178","source":"Silverchair","title":"Offsetting Effects of Wolbachia Infection and Heat Shock on Sperm Production in Drosophila simulans: Analyses of Fecundity, Fertility and Accessory Gland Proteins","title-short":"Offsetting Effects of Wolbachia Infection and Heat Shock on Sperm Production in Drosophila simulans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/155.1.167","volume":"155"},{"id":"snowdonSocialInfluencesVocal1997","abstract":"For at least 30 years, there have been close parallels between studies of birdsong development and those of the development of human language.

Recent work has been directed toward synthesizing this evidence and understanding the visual, associative, and cognitive mechanisms that are involved. The outcome is that pigeons are likely to be the non-primate species for which the computational mechanisms of object recognition are best understood. Here, we review this research and suggest that a core set of mechanisms for object recognition might be present in all vertebrates, including pigeons and people, making pigeons an excellent candidate model to study the neural mechanisms of object recognition. Behavioral and computational evidence suggests that error-driven learning participates in object category learning by pigeons and people, and recent neuroscientific research suggests that the basal ganglia, which are homologous in these species, may implement error-driven learning of stimulus-response associations. Furthermore, learning of abstract category representations can be observed in pigeons and other vertebrates. Finally, there is evidence that feedforward visual processing, a central mechanism in models of object recognition in the primate ventral stream, plays a role in object recognition by pigeons. We also highlight differences between pigeons and people in object recognition abilities, and propose candidate adaptive specializations which may explain them, such as holistic face processing and rule-based category learning in primates. From a modern comparative perspective, such specializations are to be expected regardless of the model species under study. The fact that we have a good idea of which aspects of object recognition differ in people and pigeons should be seen as an advantage over other animal models. From this perspective, we suggest that there is much to learn about human object recognition from studying the \"simple\" brains of pigeons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Soto","given":"Fabian A."},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"sotoMechanismsObjectRecognition2014","container-title":"Frontiers in Neural Circuits","container-title-short":"Front.

The birds tended to view distant objects laterally while they preferentially viewed objects less than 20–30cm away frontally; this was true whether they were looking at another bird or at an inanimate object. However, as well as switching between lateral and frontal viewing, the hens also swung their heads from side to side with movements so large that the same object appeared to be viewed with completely different parts of the retina, and even with different eyes, in rapid succession. When confronted with a novel object, the hens walked more slowly but continued to show large head movements. This suggests that, unlike mammals, which gaze fixedly at novel objects, hens investigate them by moving the head and looking at them with different, specialized, parts of their eyes. Many aspects of bird behaviour, such as search image formation, vigilance and visual discriminations, may be affected by the way they move the head and eyes.

More importantly, many studies that examine latitudinal clines in body size and the mechanisms responsible for these clines use phenotypic data, confounding genetic (adaptive) and non-genetic (plasticity) sources of variation. Yet, most of these studies make adaptive conclusions based on phenotypic measures of size. Here I show the dangers of making adaptive inferences from phenotypic measures of size. In addition, I use a specific form of plasticity in body size of ectotherms, called the temperature–size rule, to illustrate how confusion about genetic and non-genetic contributions to phenotypic variation has hampered progress in understanding the evolution of latitudinal clines in size. Field-based measurements of body size can no doubt be influenced by plasticity, but demonstrating that latitudinal clines have a genetic basis is necessary to show that these patterns are adaptive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Stillwell","given":"R.

Here, we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects. Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88% area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), much higher performance than previous general-purpose methods. With modern machine learning, including deep learning, general-purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data, with no manual recalibration, and no pretraining of the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Stowell","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Pamuła","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Stylianou","given":"Yannis"},{"family":"Glotin","given":"Hervé"}],"citation-key":"stowellAutomaticAcousticDetection2019","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13103","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"368-380","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Automatic acoustic detection of birds through deep learning: The first Bird Audio Detection challenge","title-short":"Automatic acoustic detection of birds through deep learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13103","volume":"10"},{"id":"stowellAutomaticAcousticIdentification2018","abstract":"Many animals emit vocal sounds which, independently from the sounds' function, embed some individually-distinctive signature.

If the asymmetries cannot be discriminated, fluctuating asymmetry can not be a visual cue. Here, we report an investigation of European starlings' (Sturnus vulgaris) abilities to discriminate small size asymmetries. We trained starlings, through operant conditioning in a free-flight aviary, to discriminate achromatic, symmetric paired stimuli from size-matched asymmetric stimuli. By starting the learning process with a large asymmetry and progressing through sequential trials of decreasing asymmetry, we elucidated a behavioral limit to asymmetry discrimination. We found that starlings are capable of discriminating a 10% size asymmetry. There was weaker evidence for discrimination of 5% asymmetry but no evidence for signal discrimination at 2.5% size asymmetry. This level of asymmetry discrimination suggests that many size asymmetry cues in nature can be discriminated by birds. At each level of asymmetry discrimination, we also tested whether starlings could generalize their learned symmetry preference to unreinforced novel images.

In bilaterally symmetric traits, small asymmetries (termed fluctuating asymmetry) appear due to increased developmental stress and/or genes for poor developmental homeostasis. Hence, researchers have hypothesized that symmetry can reveal the developmental history and, perhaps, fitness of an individual and this is why symmetry preferences have been observed. However, an additional theory suggests that symmetry could be preferred merely because it represents the average expression of bilateal traits. Animals can learn to respond to signals by generalizing (or averaging) stimulus sets. As the average expression of a trait showing fluctuating asymmetry is zero asymmetry, theory predicts that animals could develop a symmetry preference as a by-product of learning. Here, we test this prediction empirically with European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and show that symmetry preferences can emerge as an outcome of generalized learning processes.

To cope with harsh winters, Alpine marmots hibernate in burrows and their reproductive output should depend more on spring conditions compared to animals that are active year-round. However, we show that litter size decreased over time because of the general thinning of winter snow cover that has been repeatedly reported to occur in the Alps over the same period, despite a positive effect of an earlier snowmelt in spring. Our results contrast markedly with a recent study on North American yellow-bellied marmots, suggesting that between-species differences in life histories can lead to opposite responses to climate change, even between closely related species.

This unexpected between-sex difference of senescence in a species subject to weak sexual selection might be shaped either by costs of an asymmetric intra-sex competition for mates or by costs of social thermoregulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Tafani","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Bonenfant","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Jean-Michel"},{"family":"Lardy","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"tafaniSexspecificSenescenceBody2013","container-title":"Oecologia","container-title-short":"Oecologia","DOI":"10.1007/s00442-012-2499-1","ISSN":"1432-1939","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"427-436","source":"Springer Link","title":"Sex-specific senescence in body mass of a monogamous and monomorphic mammal: the case of Alpine marmots","title-short":"Sex-specific senescence in body mass of a monogamous and monomorphic mammal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2499-1","volume":"172"},{"id":"tarterVOCALBEHAVIORAMERICAN","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Tarter","given":""}],"citation-key":"tarterVOCALBEHAVIORAMERICAN","title":"THE VOCAL BEHAVIOR OF THE AMERICAN CROW, CORVUS BRACHYRHYNCHOS","type":"webpage","URL":"https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1204876597&disposition=inline"},{"id":"tarterVOCALBEHAVIORAMERICANa","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Tarter","given":""}],"citation-key":"tarterVOCALBEHAVIORAMERICANa","title":"THE VOCAL BEHAVIOR OF THE AMERICAN CROW, CORVUS BRACHYRHYNCHOS","type":"thesis","URL":"https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1204876597&disposition=inline"},{"id":"teamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Team","given":"RStudio"}],"citation-key":"teamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2015","container-title":"(No Title)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"source":"cir.nii.ac.jp","title":"RStudio: integrated development for R","title-short":"RStudio","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1370004240607707919"},{"id":"teichmannSeeingRedColour2020","abstract":"Colours are commonly used as visual cues when measuring animals’ cognitive abilities. However, animals can have innate biases towards certain colours that depend on ecological and evolutionary contexts, therefore potentially influencing their performance in experiments. For example, when foraging, the colour red can advertise profitable fruits or act as a warning signal about chemically defended prey, and an individual’s propensity to take food of that colour may depend on experience, age or physical condition. Here, we investigate how these contexts influence blue tits’ (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits’ (Parus major) responses to red-coloured almond flakes. We found that juvenile birds preferred red both when it was presented simultaneously with green, and when it was presented with three alternative colours (orange, purple, green). Adult birds, however, only preferred red after a positive experience with the colour, or when it was presented with the three alternative colours. We then tested whether colour influenced avoidance learning about food unpalatability. Despite the prediction that red is a more salient warning signal than green, we found only weak evidence that birds discriminated red unpalatable almonds from a green palatable alternative more quickly than when the colours were reversed. Our results suggest that biases towards red food may depend on birds’ age and previous experience, and this might influence their performance in experiments that use red stimuli. Considering the ecological relevance of colours is, therefore, important when designing experiments that involve colour cues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Teichmann","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Thorogood","given":"Rose"},{"family":"Hämäläinen","given":"Liisa"}],"citation-key":"teichmannSeeingRedColour2020","container-title":"Animal Cognition","container-title-short":"Anim Cogn","DOI":"10.1007/s10071-020-01407-x","ISSN":"1435-9456","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1007-1018","source":"Springer Link","title":"Seeing red?

When monocular birds were tested using only the naïve eye, performance dropped significantly. In right-eyed birds using the naïve left eye, performance remained at chance levels over transfer trials. However, left-eyed birds using the naïve right eye had a superior performance compared to the initial acquisition scores of right-eyed birds and also showed a significant improvement in performance over transfer trials.

In two experiments with starlings,Sturnus vulgaris, I considered whether this enhanced learning is because the observer (1) sees incorrect responses only, (2) sees both correct and incorrect responses or (3) sees an increase in the proportion of correct responses over trials. In experiment 1, individual starlings observed a demonstrator bird perform multiple simultaneous discrimination tasks. In one group, the demonstrator always picked the correct stimulus; in another group, the demonstrator always picked the incorrect stimulus; in a third group, the demonstrator consistently picked the correct stimulus 50% of the time. Those subjects that observed only incorrect choices performed significantly better than the other two groups, but none of the birds achieved the 90% correct performance criterion. Experiment 2 involved a single discrimination task; thus, a fourth group was added to control for individual learning. Again, subjects that observed only incorrect responses learned the discrimination significantly more quickly than the other three groups. Subjects that observed the demonstrator make both correct and incorrect responses were equally likely to select the same (correct) or opposite (incorrect) stimulus when the demonstrator picked the correct stimulus. When the demonstrator picked the incorrect stimulus, however, these subjects were significantly more likely to pick the opposite (correct) stimulus. These findings suggest that when learning a discrimination problem, observing a foraging companion's lack of success is more informative than observing its success.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Templeton","given":"JENNIFER J"}],"citation-key":"templetonLearningOthersMistakes1998","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1006/anbe.1997.0587","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"79-85","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Learning from others' mistakes: a paradox revisited","title-short":"Learning from others' mistakes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334729790587X","volume":"55"},{"id":"templetonNuthatchesEavesdropVariations2007","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Templeton","given":"C.

Single cone receptors are significantly more abundant in the left retina, which suggests that starlings should perform visual discrimination tasks more proficiently with the left eye, in contrast to previous findings with nonpasserines. We tested this hypothesis using the technique of monocular occlusion. In the first experiment, starlings were tested on a simultaneous visual discrimination task in three conditions: binocular (both eyes), left monocular (left eye only) and right monocular (right eye only). Subjects in the binocular and left-monocular conditions achieved significantly higher performance scores on the discrimination task than birds in the right-monocular condition. A second experiment found similar results, with birds in the left-monocular condition learning the discrimination task more than twice as quickly as those in the right-monocular condition. Subsequent tests with the alternative eye for both groups indicated no interocular transfer. These findings suggest that visual discriminative abilities in starlings are asymmetrical, and that they are lateralized in the opposite eye system than has been reported for all other species tested to date.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Templeton","given":"Jennifer J."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Diana P."}],"citation-key":"templetonReverseLateralizationVisual2004","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.04.011","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"783-788","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Reverse lateralization of visual discriminative abilities in the European starling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347203004718","volume":"67"},{"id":"templetonReverseLateralizationVisual2004a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Templeton","given":"Jennifer J."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Diana P."}],"citation-key":"templetonReverseLateralizationVisual2004a","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.04.011","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4]]},"language":"en","page":"783-788","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reverse lateralization of visual discriminative abilities in the European starling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347203004718","volume":"67"},{"id":"templetonReverseLateralizationVisual2004b","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Templeton","given":"Jennifer J."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Diana P."}],"citation-key":"templetonReverseLateralizationVisual2004b","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.04.011","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4]]},"language":"en","page":"783-788","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reverse lateralization of visual discriminative abilities in the European starling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347203004718","volume":"67"},{"id":"tencatePhoneticSyntacticProcessing2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cate","given":"Carel","non-dropping-particle":"ten"}],"citation-key":"tencatePhoneticSyntacticProcessing2014","container-title":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.conb.2014.07.019","ISSN":"09594388","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10]]},"language":"en","page":"157-164","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the phonetic and syntactic processing abilities of birds: From songs to speech and artificial grammars","title-short":"On the phonetic and syntactic processing abilities of birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959438814001561","volume":"28"},{"id":"teplitskyBergmannsRuleClimate2008","abstract":"Ecological responses to on-going climate change are numerous, diverse, and taxonomically widespread.

We used a dataset of individually marked red-billed gulls (Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus) from New Zealand to document phenotypic and genetic changes in mean body mass over a 47-year (1958–2004) period. We found that, whereas the mean body mass had decreased over time as ambient temperatures increased, analyses of breeding values estimated with an “animal model” approach showed no evidence for any genetic change.

The mechanisms behind this rule are still debated, and it is not clear whether Bergmann's rule can be extended to predict the effects of climate change through time. We reviewed the primary literature for evidence (i) of a decrease in body size in response to climate warming, (ii) that changing body size is an adaptive response and (iii) that these responses are evolutionary or plastic. We found weak evidence for changes in body size through time as predicted by Bergmann's rule. Only three studies investigated the adaptive nature of these size decreases. Of these, none reported evidence of selection for smaller size or of a genetic basis for the size change, suggesting that size decreases could be due to nonadaptive plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions.

In these systems, the ability to selectively choose ﬂock members is essential in order to maximise individual ﬁtness. As a result, most species of parrots have individual distinctive contact calls that mediate the formation of groups during ﬁssion and fusion events. However, in vocal interactions during ﬁssion and fusion events, individuals will modify the ﬁne-scale structure of their contact calls in a manner that sometimes will result in imitation of the contact calls of another individual, potentially altering or weakening the individual distinctiveness of contact calls. This presents parrots with an interesting dilemma. Here we present a study investigating the effect of vocal modiﬁcation during interactions, including vocal imitation, on the individual distinctiveness and sex-speciﬁc differences of contact calls from ten captive bred peach-fronted conures (Eupsittula aurea). In order to determine if vocal individual- and sex distinctiveness persists in contact calls that are modiﬁed to that of another individual, we compared nine acoustic parameters from spontaneous (baseline) contact calls and contact calls emitted as response to a playback stimulus. Although modiﬁed, all acoustic parameters remained individually distinctive when the focal individuals interacted with the playback stimulus. These results provide a strong basis for discriminating between calls from different individuals across several social contexts, which could play an important role in mediating selective associations between individual peach-fronted conures during ﬁssion and fusion events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomsen","given":"Heidi M."},{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten J.S."},{"family":"Dabelsteen","given":"Torben"}],"citation-key":"thomsenImitationDilemmaCan2019","container-title":"Behaviour","container-title-short":"Behav.","DOI":"10.1163/1568539X-00003548","ISSN":"0005-7959, 1568-539X","issue":"5-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"787-814","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The imitation dilemma: can parrots maintain their vocal individuality when imitating conspecifics?","title-short":"The imitation dilemma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/156/5-8/article-p787_13.xml","volume":"156"},{"id":"thomsenIndividualVariationContact2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomsen","given":"Heidi M."},{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten J.S."},{"family":"Dabelsteen","given":"Torben"}],"citation-key":"thomsenIndividualVariationContact2013","container-title":"Bioacoustics","container-title-short":"Bioacoustics","DOI":"10.1080/09524622.2013.779560","ISSN":"0952-4622, 2165-0586","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10]]},"language":"en","page":"215-227","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Individual variation in the contact calls of the monomorphic Peach-fronted Conure, <i>Aratinga aurea</i> , and its potential role in communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09524622.2013.779560","volume":"22"},{"id":"thomsenIndividualVariationContact2013a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomsen","given":"Heidi M."},{"family":"Balsby","given":"Thorsten J.S."},{"family":"Dabelsteen","given":"Torben"}],"citation-key":"thomsenIndividualVariationContact2013a","container-title":"Bioacoustics","container-title-short":"Bioacoustics","DOI":"10.1080/09524622.2013.779560","ISSN":"0952-4622, 2165-0586","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10]]},"language":"en","page":"215-227","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Individual variation in the contact calls of the monomorphic Peach-fronted Conure, <i>Aratinga aurea</i> , and its potential role in communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09524622.2013.779560","volume":"22"},{"id":"thorndikeAnimalIntelligenceExperimental1898","abstract":"This monograph is an attempt at an explanation of the nature of the process of association in the animal mind.

These findings pose a theoretical problem. It seems that there would be disadvantages in having a substantial degree of asymmetry in the use of the two eyes; a deficit on one side would leave the organism vulnerable to attack on that side or unable to exploit resources appearing on one side. We here report a possible solution to the problem. We have found that domestic chicks show selective use of the lateral visual field of the left eye and of the right hemifield in the binocular, frontal visual field when they peck at strangers but not at cagemates. Thus, during social recognition, there seems to be opposite and complementary left-right specialization for the lateral and frontal visual fields of the two eyes.

Recent advances in comparative cognitive neurosciences have made available new animal models that have started to provide unexpected insights into the evolutionary origins and neuronal mechanisms of cerebral asymmetries. Animal model-systems, particularly those provided by the avian brain, highlight the interrelations of genetic, hormonal and environmental events to produce neural and behavioural asymmetries. Novel evidences showing that functional and structural lateralization of the brain is widespread among vertebrates (including fish, reptiles and amphibians) have accumulated rapidly. Perceptual asymmetries, in particular, seem to be ubiquitous in everyday behaviour of most species of animals with laterally placed eyes; in organisms with wider binocular overlap (e.g., amphibians), they appear to be retained for initial detection of stimuli in the extreme lateral fields. We speculate that adjustment of head position and eye movements may play a similar role in mammals with frontal vision as does the choice for right or left lateral visual fields in animals with laterally placed eyes. A first attempt to trace back the origins of brain asymmetry to early vertebrates is presented, based on the hypothesis that functional incompatibility between the logical demands associated with very basic cognitive functions is central to the phenomenon of cerebral lateralization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Vallortigara","given":"G"},{"family":"Rogers","given":"L.

The predisposition seems to reflect the existence of a mechanism in the brain aimed at orienting the young animal towards objects that move semi-rigidly (as vertebrate animals do), thus facilitating learning, i.e., through imprinting, about their more specific features of motion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Vallortigara","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Regolin","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Marconato","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"vallortigaraVisuallyInexperiencedChicks2005","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.0030208","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6,7]]},"language":"en","page":"e208","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Visually Inexperienced Chicks Exhibit Spontaneous Preference for Biological Motion Patterns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030208","volume":"3"},{"id":"vasconcelosTransitiveInferenceNonhuman2008","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Vasconcelos","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"vasconcelosTransitiveInferenceNonhuman2008","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2008.02.017","ISSN":"03766357","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]},"language":"en","page":"313-334","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transitive inference in non-human animals: An empirical and theoretical analysis","title-short":"Transitive inference in non-human animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376635708000818","volume":"78"},{"id":"vauclairCategorizationConceptualBehavior2002","abstract":"This essay describes some of the studies that have been carried out in the past 5 years with two species of baboons, both in laboratory-controlled conditions (Guinea baboons, Papio papio) and in outdoor settings (olive baboons, Papio anubis).","author":[{"family":"Vauclair","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"vauclairCategorizationConceptualBehavior2002","container-title":"The cognitive animal","container-title-short":"The cognitive animal","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",1,1]]},"page":"239-245","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Categorization and conceptual behavior in nonhuman primates","type":"chapter"},{"id":"vaughanFormationEquivalenceSets1988","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaughan","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"vaughanFormationEquivalenceSets1988","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes","DOI":"10.1037/0097-7403.14.1.36","ISSN":"1939-2184, 0097-7403","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"language":"en","page":"36-42","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Formation of equivalence sets in pigeons.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0097-7403.14.1.36","volume":"14"},{"id":"vaughanFormationEquivalenceSets1988a","author":[{"family":"Vaughan","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"vaughanFormationEquivalenceSets1988a","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes","DOI":"10.1037/0097-7403.14.1.36","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"page":"36-42","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Formation of Equivalence Sets in Pigeons","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},{"id":"vaughanPigeonVisualMemory1984","abstract":"Four experiments examined visual memory capacity in 13 White Carneaux pigeons.

Although these conflicts can sometimes be dealt with pre-copulatorily (e.g. by choosing with which partners to mate), they often extend beyond copulation. Post-copulatory sexual conflicts are expected to be particularly strong in simultaneous hermaphrodites because an individual may have to accept sperm in order to obtain an opportunity to donate sperm, reducing the effectiveness of pre-copulatory conflict resolution. The present study investigates the post-copulatory interactions between male and female sexual traits of a highly promiscuous simultaneous hermaphrodite, the free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano.

Problematic groups are geese, cranes, rails, raptors, owls, parrots, doves, auks, shearwaters and some passerines. Commonly accepted invasive sexing techniques based on genetics, laparoscopy, morphometric and on cloacal inspection, are all needed in bird capturing and handling. Capturing and subsequent manipulations may be inapplicable for free-ranging birds, whereas distant voice-based sexing is relevant for many species. This review evaluates the potential for noninvasive sexing by separate calls or duet calls, for adult birds of 69 species from 16 orders and for chicks of 11 species from 7 orders. For adult birds of 25 species, a single call per individual was sufficient for 100 % reliable sexing by ear or using spectrographic analysis. For chicks, the potential for voice-based sexing seems to be very limited. For birds calling rarely or unpredictably, we propose a simple way of provoking vocalization using playbacks of species-specific calls that are available from sound libraries. We conclude that sexing by voice may represent a feasible alternative to the classical sexing techniques, both in the wild and in captivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Volodin","given":"Ilya A."},{"family":"Volodina","given":"Elena V."},{"family":"Klenova","given":"Anna V."},{"family":"Matrosova","given":"Vera A."}],"citation-key":"volodinGenderIdentificationUsing2015","container-title":"Avian Research","container-title-short":"Avian Res","DOI":"10.1186/s40657-015-0033-y","ISSN":"2053-7166","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,13]]},"language":"en","page":"20","source":"Springer Link","title":"Gender identification using acoustic analysis in birds without external sexual dimorphism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40657-015-0033-y","volume":"6"},{"id":"vonfersenVisualMemoryLateralization1990","abstract":"Previous experiments employing simple visual discrimination tasks have revealed a cerebral lateralization in the visual system of pigeons with a dominance of the left hemisphere.

We investigate whether the song control nuclei of crows show any sexual differences in size, reflecting differences in their singing behavior, and whether these nuclei are different from those of other songbirds in terms of neural connectivity size and relative to the forebrain. Our Nissl staining results reveal that 1) of the four song nuclei examined (HVC; the robust nucleus of the arcopallium [RA]; Area X; and the dorsolateral medial nucleus [DLM]), HVC, RA, and Area X volumes are significantly larger in males than in females, but DLM volume and body and brain weights show no significant gender differences; and 2) the sizes of song nuclei relative to the forebrain are within the range of other oscines. By injecting a neural tract tracer (DiI) into various song nuclei in brain slices, we found that, as in other songbirds, HVC projects to RA and Area X, while Area X projects to the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (lMAN) and DLM, DLM to lMAN, and lMAN to RA. Our results indicate that, although the crow has songs very different from those of other oscine species, its song nuclei and the connections between them are not obviously different.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Sun","given":"YingYu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"XueBo"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"ShaoJu"},{"family":"Xie","given":"WenQing"},{"family":"Yu","given":"YueQiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"XinWen"},{"family":"Zuo","given":"MingXue"}],"citation-key":"wangSongControlNuclei2009","container-title":"Zoological Science","container-title-short":"jzoo","DOI":"10.2108/zsj.26.771","ISSN":"0289-0003","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11]]},"page":"771-777","publisher":"Zoological Society of Japan","source":"bioone.org","title":"Song Control Nuclei in Male and Female Large-Billed Crows (Corvus macrorhynchos)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioone.org/journals/Zoological-Science/volume-26/issue-11/zsj.26.771/Song-Control-Nuclei-in-Male-and-Female-Large-Billed-Crows/10.2108/zsj.26.771.full","volume":"26"},{"id":"wankerDiscriminationDifferentSocial1998","abstract":"Individual recognition is generally assumed to be a prerequisite for establishing and maintaining a complex social system.

Consequently, between-species recognition, based either on familiarity or even individual recognition, is likely to be beneﬁcial. The extent to which animals can distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar heterospeciﬁcs is currently unclear. In the present study, we investigated the ability of eight carrion crows to differentiate between the voices and calls of familiar and unfamiliar humans and jackdaws.

It liberated interest in complex learning and cognition from the grasp of the rigid theoretical structures of behaviorism that had prevailed during the previous four decades, and as a result, the field of comparative cognition was born. At long last, the study of the cognitive capacities of animals other than humans emerged as a worthwhile scientific enterprise. No less rigorous than purely behavioristic investigations, studies of animal intelligence spanned such wide-ranging topics as perception, spatial learning and memory, timing and numerical competence, categorization and conceptualization, problem solving, rule learning, and creativity.During the ensuing 25 years, the field of comparative cognition has thrived and grown, and public interest in it has risen to unprecedented levels. In their quest to understand the nature and mechanisms of intelligence, researchers have studied animals from bees to chimpanzees. Sessions on comparative cognition have become common at meetings of the major societies for psychology and neuroscience, and in fact, research in comparative cognition has increased so much that a separate society, the Comparative Cognition Society, has been formed to bring it together.This volume celebrates comparative cognition's first quarter century with a state-of-the-art collection of chapters covering the broad realm of the scientific study of animal intelligence. Comparative Cognition will be an invaluable resource for students and professional researchers in all areas of psychology and neuroscience.","author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Stuit Professor of Experimental Psychology Edward A."},{"family":"Zentall","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Zentall","given":"DiSilvestro Professor of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Psychology Thomas R."}],"citation-key":"wassermanComparativeCognitionExperimental2006","ISBN":"978-0-19-516765-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"734","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Comparative Cognition: Experimental Explorations of Animal Intelligence","title-short":"Comparative Cognition","type":"book"},{"id":"wassermanComparativeCognitionExperimental2006a","author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Zentall","given":"Thomas R."}],"citation-key":"wassermanComparativeCognitionExperimental2006a","ISBN":"978-0-19-516765-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"734","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Comparative Cognition: Experimental Explorations of Animal Intelligence","title-short":"Comparative Cognition","type":"book"},{"id":"wassermanComparativeCognitionExperimental2009","author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A"}],"citation-key":"wassermanComparativeCognitionExperimental2009","ISBN":"978-0-19-537780-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 1027876120","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Comparative cognition: experimental explorations of animal intelligence(9780195377804).","title-short":"Comparative cognition","type":"book"},{"id":"wassermanConceptualBehaviorPigeons","author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"E A"},{"family":"Kiedinger","given":"R E"},{"family":"Bhatt","given":"R S"}],"citation-key":"wassermanConceptualBehaviorPigeons","language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Conceptual Behavior in Pigeons: Categories, Subcategories, and Pseudocategori.es","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"wassermanConceptualBehaviorPigeons1988","author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"E A"},{"family":"Kiedinger","given":"R E"},{"family":"Bhatt","given":"R S"}],"citation-key":"wassermanConceptualBehaviorPigeons1988","DOI":"10.1037/0097-7403.14.3.235","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"language":"en","page":"235","source":"Zotero","title":"Conceptual Behavior in Pigeons: Categories, Subcategories, and Pseudocategori.es","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},{"id":"wassermanConceptualizationPigeonsEvolution2016","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"wassermanConceptualizationPigeonsEvolution2016","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","container-title-short":"Behavioural Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.beproc.2015.09.010","ISSN":"03766357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2]]},"language":"en","page":"4-14","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conceptualization in pigeons: The evolution of a paradigm","title-short":"Conceptualization in pigeons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376635715300401","volume":"123"},{"id":"wassermanConceptualizationPigeonsEvolution2016a","author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A"}],"citation-key":"wassermanConceptualizationPigeonsEvolution2016a","container-title":"Behavioural Processes","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Conceptualization in pigeons: The evolution of a paradigm","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"wassermanPicturePerceptionBirdsEye1993","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."}],"citation-key":"wassermanPicturePerceptionBirdsEye1993","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769738","ISSN":"0963-7214","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",12,1]]},"page":"184-189","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Picture Perception: A Bird's-Eye View","title-short":"Picture Perception","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769738","volume":"2"},{"id":"wassermanPigeonsAcquireMultiple2015","abstract":"Might there be parallels between category learning in animals and word learning in children? To examine this possibility, we devised a new associative learning technique for teaching pigeons to sort 128 photographs of objects into 16 human language categories. We found that pigeons learned all 16 categories in parallel, they perceived the perceptual coherence of the different object categories, and they generalized their categorization behavior to novel photographs from the training categories. More detailed analyses of the factors that predict trial-by-trial learning implicated a number of factors that may shape learning. First, we found considerable trial-by-trial dependency of pigeons’ categorization responses, consistent with several recent studies that invoke this dependency to claim that humans acquire words via symbolic or inferential mechanisms; this finding suggests that such dependencies may also arise in associative systems. Second, our trial-by-trial analyses divulged seemingly irrelevant aspects of the categorization task, like the spatial location of the report responses, which influenced learning. Third, those trial-by-trial analyses also supported the possibility that learning may be determined both by strengthening correct stimulus–response associations and by weakening incorrect stimulus–response associations. The parallel between all these findings and important aspects of human word learning suggests that associative learning mechanisms may play a much stronger part in complex human behavior than is commonly believed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Daniel I."},{"family":"McMurray","given":"Bob"}],"citation-key":"wassermanPigeonsAcquireMultiple2015","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2014.11.020","ISSN":"0010-0277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"99-122","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pigeons acquire multiple categories in parallel via associative learning: A parallel to human word learning?","title-short":"Pigeons acquire multiple categories in parallel via associative learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027714002406","volume":"136"},{"id":"wassermanPigeonsAcquireMultiple2015a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Wasserman","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Daniel I."},{"family":"McMurray","given":"Bob"}],"citation-key":"wassermanPigeonsAcquireMultiple2015a","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2014.11.020","ISSN":"00100277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3]]},"language":"en","page":"99-122","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pigeons acquire multiple categories in parallel via associative learning: A parallel to human word learning?","title-short":"Pigeons acquire multiple categories in parallel via associative learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027714002406","volume":"136"},{"id":"wassermanPigeonsAreSensitive1993","abstract":"Two experimellts investigated the role ofspatial organization in the discrimination and generalization of complex visual stimuli by pigeons.

These shifts are occurring more rapidly at higher elevations and latitudes, likely causing disproportionate effects to mammalian hibernators there. While there is some information about how these species' ranges are responding to climatic shifts, we lack an understanding of how climate components are affecting species' life history variation, which is key to individual success and population-level resilience. We reviewed the literature to identify the direction of life history responses to climate change in mammalian hibernators along three axes: latitudinal, elevational and temporal. We found 39 studies involving 27 species that reported climate effects on our four target life history traits – phenology, body mass/condition and growth, reproduction and survival. We found warmer temperatures are advancing hibernator phenology and increasing reproductive success. By contrast, warming and drying trends are having uncertain effects on body condition, and complex effects on survival – depending on season, age class, latitude and elevation. We found no pattern of significant climate-trait outcomes by duration or decade of study. More research on drought conditions – particularly in relation to resource availability – would help inform hibernator susceptibility to increased drying trends expected to intensify globally. Notably, our results are highly biased towards small mammal hibernators in Northern Hemisphere alpine/mountain ecosystems, with few long-term studies conducted on Southern Hemisphere hibernators. This review highlights that phenological shifts constitute one of the most obvious consequences of climate change, yet, the timing of life history events (e.g. timing of migration, reproduction, hibernation) remains poorly understood. Further integration of insights from physiologists, evolutionary biologists and population ecologists working on wild populations will improve our collective understanding of the effects of seasonal climatic shifts on mammalian hibernator life history traits, key drivers of their population-level persistence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Wells","given":"Caitlin P."},{"family":"Barbier","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Shelley"},{"family":"Kanaziz","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Aubry","given":"Lise M."}],"citation-key":"wellsLifeHistoryConsequences2022","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.06056","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 The Authors.

However, some signals are produced in multiple contexts. To a given receiver, such a signal may only sometimes be relevant. Here, I demonstrate that receivers use contextual variation in signal form as a cue to their relevance. Individuals from 15 species of songbirds repeated their calls rapidly when confronting widely threatening predators, but repeated the same calls more slowly during other types of social interactions. In playback experiments, repetition rate was a cue to nestling Ficedula flycatchers, which reduced their activity in response to quickly but not slowly repeated calls, and also to adult birds from a variety of species, which responded more strongly to the calls of their own and other species produced at faster rates. These results show that repetition rate is an innate or early learned contextual cue and, in combination with learning about heterospecific signals, allows receivers to fine-tune their responses to the calls of their own and other species according to their relevance, suggesting that simple rules facilitate widespread heterospecific communication networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Wheatcroft","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"wheatcroftRepetitionRateCalls2015","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.02.009","ISSN":"0003-3472","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"35-44","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Repetition rate of calls used in multiple contexts communicates presence of predators to nestlings and adult birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347215000688","volume":"103"},{"id":"WhenWhatWhom","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"citation-key":"WhenWhatWhom","title":"When, what, and whom to watch?

To distinguish between group members and strangers in an efficient way, it would be adaptive for an animal to categorize conspecifics on the basis of familiarity. We investigated whether pigeons, Columba livia, are able to learn this categorization in a concept-like manner when trained with 2D images of conspecifics. Two of the six experimental pigeons were able correctly to classify test photographs of aviary mates which they had never seen as photographic stimuli before. Control animals, which had no real-life experience of the pictured conspecifics, all failed. This is a cognitively demanding task; not only are there no consistent visual features among group members, but photographic stimuli also present a much degraded version of the depicted pigeons. Further tests revealed that the familiarity concept could be transferred to nonconspecifics and that 24h of exposure was enough for another pigeon to be classed as familiar. In sum, the findings show that pigeons (1) interpreted computer stimuli as representations of real entities, (2) possessed the ability to form a concept of familiarity and (3) were able to distinguish between social partners and strangers in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Specht","given":"Hanna L."},{"family":"Huber","given":"Ludwig"}],"citation-key":"wilkinsonPigeonsCanDiscriminate2010a","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.04.006","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109-115","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pigeons can discriminate group mates from strangers using the concept of familiarity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210001363","volume":"80"},{"id":"wilsonEcologistsGuideAnimal2010","abstract":"1.

A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model, known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research. 3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations. 4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models. 5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Alastair J."},{"family":"Réale","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Clements","given":"Michelle N."},{"family":"Morrissey","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Postma","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Walling","given":"Craig A."},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E.

For magnetoreception, two hypotheses are currently discussed: one proposing magnetite-based mechanisms, the other suggesting radical pair processes involving photopigments. Behavioral studies indicate that birds use both mechanisms: they responded to a short, strong magnetic pulse designed to change the magnetization of magnetite particles, while, at the same time, their orientation was found to be light-dependent and could be disrupted by high-frequency magnetic fields in the MHz range, which is diagnostic for radical pair processes. Details of these findings, together with electrophysiological and histological studies, suggest that, in birds, a radical pair mechanism located in the right eye provides directional information for a compass, while a magnetite-based mechanism located in the upper beak records magnetic intensity, thus providing positional information. The mechanisms of magnetoreception in other animals have not yet been analyzed in detail.

Although these social effects on fitness and trait expression may appear to be purely environmental, they differ from other sorts of environmental influences, because they can have a genetic basis and thus can contribute to evolution. Theory has shown that these effects modify the definition of genetic architecture by making the phenotype the property of the genotypes of multiple individuals and alter evolutionary dynamics by introducing additional heritable components contributing to trait evolution. These effects suggest that genetic and evolutionary analyses of traits influenced by social environments must incorporate the genetic components of variation contributed by these environments. However, empirical studies incorporating these effects are generally lacking. In this paper, I quantify the contribution of genetically based environmental effects arising from social interactions during group rearing to the quantitative genetics of body size in Drosophila melanogaster. The results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of body size contains an important component of variation contributed by the social environment, which is hidden to ordinary genetic analyses and opposes the direct effects of genes on body-size development within a population. Using a model of trait evolution, I show that these effects significantly alter evolutionary predictions by providing hidden constraints on phenotypic evolution. The importance of relatedness of interactants and the potential impact of kin selection on the evolution of body size are also examined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolf","given":"Jason B."}],"citation-key":"wolfGeneticArchitectureEvolutionary2003","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0635741100","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4,15]]},"page":"4655-4660","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Genetic architecture and evolutionary constraint when the environment contains genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0635741100","volume":"100"},{"id":"wolfGeneticArchitectureWing2000","abstract":"Two models of evolutionary change invoke either additive genetic contributions to phenotypic traits (Fisher) or epistatic as well as additive effects (Wright).

When such collective actions are initiated by recruitment signals, individuals may benefit from being selective in whom they join, so the identity of the initiator may determine the magnitude of the group response. However, the role of signaller discrimination in coordinating group-level responses has yet to be tested. Here we show that in wild jackdaws, a colonial corvid species, collective responses to anti-predator recruitment calls are mediated by caller characteristics. In playbacks next to nestboxes, the calls of nestbox residents attracted most recruits, followed in turn by other colony members, non-colony members and rooks (a sympatric corvid). Playbacks in fields outside nestbox colonies, where the immediate threat to broods was lower, showed similar results, with highest recruitment to nearby colony members’ calls. Responses were further influenced by caller sex: calls from non-colony member females were less likely to elicit responsive scolding by recruits than other calls, potentially reflecting social rank associated with sex and colony membership. These results show that vocal discrimination mediates jackdaws’ collective responses and highlight the need for further research into the cognitive basis of collective actions in animal groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Woods","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Kings","given":"Michael"},{"family":"McIvor","given":"Guillam E."},{"family":"Thornton","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"woodsCallerCharacteristicsInfluence2018","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-25793-y","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,9]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-8","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.passerelle.univ-rennes1.fr","title":"Caller characteristics influence recruitment to collective anti-predator events in jackdaws","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25793-y","volume":"8"},{"id":"woodsCollectiveResponsesAcoustic","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Woods","given":""}],"citation-key":"woodsCollectiveResponsesAcoustic","title":"Collective responses to acoustic threat information in jackdaws.","type":"thesis","URL":"https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/25978/WoodsR.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y"},{"id":"wranghamHypothesesEvolutionReduced2019","abstract":"Parallels in anatomy between humans and domesticated mammals suggest that for the last 300,000 years, Homo sapiens has experienced more intense selection against the propensity for reactive aggression than other species of Homo. Selection against reactive aggression, a process that can also be called self-domestication, would help explain various physiological, behavioral, and cognitive features of humans, including the unique system of egalitarian male hierarchy in mobile hunter-gatherers. Here I review nine leading proposals for the occurrence of self-domestication in H. sapiens. To account for the domestication syndrome, proposals must explain what led to a decline in fitness of highly aggressive males, and why the explanatory factor applies only to H. sapiens and not to other species of Homo. The proposed explanations invoke genetic group selection; group-structured culture selection (also known as cultural group selection); social selection by female mate choice; social selection by male partner choice; increased self-control; cooperative breeding; high population density; use of lethal weapons; and language-based conspiracy. Most of these proposals face difficulties in accounting for the origins and/or maintenance of reduced reactive aggression. I conclude that the evolution of language-based conspiracy, which is a form of collective intentionality, was the key factor initiating and maintaining self-domestication in H. sapiens, because it is the most convincing mechanism for explaining the selective pressure against individually powerful fighters. Sophisticated language enabled males of low fighting prowess to cooperatively plan the execution of physically aggressive and domineering alpha males. This system is known today as a leveling mechanism in small-scale societies. Group-structured culture selection possibly accelerated the process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wrangham","given":"Richard W."}],"citation-key":"wranghamHypothesesEvolutionReduced2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Hypotheses for the Evolution of Reduced Reactive Aggression in the Context of Human Self-Domestication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01914","volume":"10"},{"id":"wrightRegionalDialectsContact1996","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Timothy F."}],"citation-key":"wrightRegionalDialectsContact1996","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Vocal dialects have provided a useful model for the study of cultural evolution and its interactions with genetic evolution. This study examined the acoustic and geographic changes in vocal dialects over an eleven-year span in the yellow-naped amazon, Amazona auropalliata, in Costa Rica. Contact calls were recorded at 16 communal night roosts in 1994 and 19 roosts in 2005, with 12 roosts sampled in both surveys. In both surveys three dialects were found, each characterized by a distinctive contact call type and each encompassing multiple roosts. The limits between two of these dialects, the North and South dialects, was found to be geographically stable, while at the boundary between the North and Nicaraguan dialect there was introgression of each call type into roosts in the bordering dialect. Acoustic measurements and cross-correlations of spectrograms detected no change in the acoustic structure of contact calls in the South dialect but did show significant differences in the calls of both the North and Nicaraguan dialect between 1994 and 2005. These results are consistent with the vocal convergence hypothesis that proposes that dialects are long-term features maintained through some combination of biased transmission of local call types and purifying selection against foreign call types. Migration, copying errors and cultural drift may also play a role in the more subtle changes seen in the acoustic form of dialect call types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"WRIGHT","given":"TIMOTHY F."},{"family":"DAHLIN","given":"CHRISTINE R."},{"family":"SALINAS-MELGOZA","given":"ALEJANDRO"}],"citation-key":"wrightStabilityChangeVocal2008a","container-title":"Animal behaviour","container-title-short":"Anim Behav","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.03.025","ISSN":"0003-3472","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9]]},"page":"1017-1027","PMCID":"PMC2598431","PMID":"19727330","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Stability and change in vocal dialects of the yellow-naped amazon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598431/","volume":"76"},{"id":"wrightVocalDialectsParrots2018","abstract":"Vocal dialects have fascinated biologists for over 50 years. This mosaic pattern of geographic variation in learned vocalizations was first described in a songbird, and since that time, most studies investigating dialects have focused on songbird species. Here we examine patterns of geographic variation in the calls of a different group of vocal learning birds, the parrots (Order Psittaciformes). We summarize the growing literature on vocal variation in parrots, and complement this review with a survey of variation in the genus Amazona using calls from sound libraries. We find strikingly similar patterns to those previously found in songbirds. Over 90% of parrots examined in the literature, and 69% of Amazona species surveyed, showed geographic variation consistent with a propensity to share local call types. This trait is evolutionarily labile and widespread; within Amazona most clades contained species with and without geographic variation, and most major lineages of parrots include representatives with dialects. We found little support for the long-standing hypothesis that dialects isolate populations and thus generate genetic differences among populations. Instead, most studies support the idea that dialects are maintained by social benefits of matching local call types, a finding that has implications for the management of captive and endangered populations. Considerable scope remains for studies that experimentally test hypotheses for the exact nature of these benefits, as well as studies that employ comparisons among species, to understand how the interplay between ecology, social dynamics and vocal learning capacities produces different patterns of variation across the parrots.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Timothy F."},{"family":"Dahlin","given":"Christine R."}],"citation-key":"wrightVocalDialectsParrots2018","container-title":"The Emu","container-title-short":"Emu","DOI":"10.1080/01584197.2017.1379356","ISSN":"0158-4197","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"50-66","PMCID":"PMC6020700","PMID":"29962561","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Vocal dialects in parrots: patterns and processes of cultural evolution","title-short":"Vocal dialects in parrots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6020700/","volume":"118"},{"id":"wudarskiFreelivingFlatwormMacrostomum2020","abstract":"Macrostomum lignano is a free-living flatworm that is emerging as an attractive experimental animal for research on a broad range of biological questions. One feature setting it apart from other flatworms is the successful establishment of transgenesis methods, facilitated by a steady supply of eggs in the form of single-cell zygotes that can be readily manipulated. This, in combination with the transparency of the animal and its small size, creates practical advantages for imaging and fluorescence-activated cell sorting in studies related to stem cell biology and regeneration. M. lignano can regenerate most of its body parts, including the germline, thanks to the neoblasts, which represent the flatworm stem cell system. Interestingly, neoblasts seem to have a high capacity of cellular maintenance, as M. lignano can survive up to 210 Gy of γ-irradiation, and partially offset the negative consequence of ageing. As a non-self-fertilizing simultaneous hermaphrodite that reproduces in a sexual manner, M. lignano is also used to study sexual selection and other evolutionary aspects of sexual reproduction. Work over the past several years has led to the development of molecular resources and tools, including high-quality genome and transcriptome assemblies, transcriptional profiling of the germline and somatic neoblasts, gene knockdown, and in situ hybridization. The increasingly detailed characterization of this animal has also resulted in novel research questions, such as bio-adhesion based on its adhesion-release glands and genome evolution due to its recent whole-genome duplication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Wudarski","given":"Jakub"},{"family":"Egger","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Ramm","given":"Steven A."},{"family":"Schärer","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Ladurner","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Zadesenets","given":"Kira S."},{"family":"Rubtsov","given":"Nikolay B."},{"family":"Mouton","given":"Stijn"},{"family":"Berezikov","given":"Eugene"}],"citation-key":"wudarskiFreelivingFlatwormMacrostomum2020","container-title":"EvoDevo","container-title-short":"EvoDevo","DOI":"10.1186/s13227-020-00150-1","ISSN":"2041-9139","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,2]]},"language":"en","page":"5","source":"Springer Link","title":"The free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13227-020-00150-1","volume":"11"},{"id":"yaltaGoldenRatioHeart2016","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Yalta","given":"Kenan"},{"family":"Ozturk","given":"Selcuk"},{"family":"Yetkin","given":"Ertan"}],"citation-key":"yaltaGoldenRatioHeart2016","container-title":"International Journal of Cardiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.03.166","ISSN":"01675273","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7]]},"language":"en","page":"107-112","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Golden Ratio and the heart: A review of divine aesthetics","title-short":"Golden Ratio and the heart","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167527316305885","volume":"214"},{"id":"yamazakiLateralizedCognitionAsymmetrical2007","author":[{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Y"},{"family":"Aust","given":"U"},{"family":"Huber","given":"L"},{"family":"Hausmann","given":"M"},{"family":"Güntürkün","given":"O"}],"citation-key":"yamazakiLateralizedCognitionAsymmetrical2007","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Lateralized cognition: Asymmetrical and complementary strategies of pigeons during discrimination of the “human concept” ଝ","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"yamazakiLateralizedCognitionAsymmetrical2007a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Y."},{"family":"Aust","given":"U."},{"family":"Huber","given":"L."},{"family":"Hausmann","given":"M."},{"family":"Güntürkün","given":"O."}],"citation-key":"yamazakiLateralizedCognitionAsymmetrical2007a","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2006.07.004","ISSN":"00100277","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8]]},"language":"en","page":"315-344","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lateralized cognition: Asymmetrical and complementary strategies of pigeons during discrimination of the “human concept”","title-short":"Lateralized cognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027706001545","volume":"104"},{"id":"yamazakiLateralizedCognitionAsymmetrical2007b","abstract":"This study was aimed at revealing which cognitive processes are lateralized in visual categorizations of “humans” by pigeons.

We argue that body size acts much like a barometer, ﬂuctuating in parallel with changes in the relevant key predictor(s), and that geographical and temporal changes in body size are actually manifestations of the same drivers. Frequently, the principal predictors of body size are food availability during the period of growth and ambient temperature, which often affects food availability. Food availability depends on net primary productivity that, in turn, is determined by climate and weather (mainly temperature and precipitation), and these depend mainly on solar radiation and other solar activities. When the above predictors are related to latitude the changes have often been interpreted as conforming to Bergmann’s rule, but in many cases such interpretations should be viewed with caution due to the interrelationships among various environmental predictors. Recent temporal changes in body size have often been related to global warming. However, in many cases the above key predictors are not related to either latitude and/or year, and it is the task of the researcher to determine which particular environmental predictor is the one that determines food availability and, in turn, body size. The chance of discerning a signiﬁcant change in body size depends to a large extent on sample size (specimens/year). The most recent changes in body size are probably phenotypic, but there are some cases in which they are partly genetic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Yom-Tov","given":"Yoram"},{"family":"Geffen","given":"Eli"}],"citation-key":"yom-tovRecentSpatialTemporal2011","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00168.x","ISSN":"14647931","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1","page":"531-541","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent spatial and temporal changes in body size of terrestrial vertebrates: probable causes and pitfalls","title-short":"Recent spatial and temporal changes in body size of terrestrial vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00168.x","volume":"86"},{"id":"yorzinskiEyeHeadMovements2015","abstract":"Animals selectively direct their visual attention toward relevant aspects of their environments.

While we have a growing understanding of eye and head movements in mammals, we know little about these processes in birds. We therefore measured the eye and head movements of freely behaving Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) using a telemetric eye-tracker. Both eye and head movements contributed to gaze changes in peafowl. When gaze shifts were smaller, eye movements played a larger role than when gaze shifts were larger. The duration and velocity of eye and head movements were positively related to the size of the eye and head movements, respectively. In addition, the coordination of eye and head movements in peafowl differed from that in mammals; peafowl exhibited a near-absence of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which may partly result from the peafowl's ability to move their heads as quickly as their eyes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Yorzinski","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Patricelli","given":"Gail L."},{"family":"Platt","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Land","given":"Michael F."}],"citation-key":"yorzinskiEyeHeadMovements2015","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.129544","ISSN":"0022-0949","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,1]]},"page":"3771-3776","source":"Silverchair","title":"Eye and head movements shape gaze shifts in Indian peafowl","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.129544","volume":"218"},{"id":"yorzinskiInflectedAlarmCaw2006","abstract":"Previous research on individual differences in the acoustic structure of vocalizations and vocal recognition has largely focused on the contexts of parent-offspring interactions, territory defense, sexual interactions, and group cohesion. In contrast, few studies have examined individual differences in the acoustic structure of mobbing and alarm calls. The purpose of this study was to explore individual differences in the acoustic structure of the inflected alarm caw of the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). The alarm caws of 15 wild, marked individuals were recorded and 25 acoustic measurements were made automatically using customized software. A stepwise discriminant function analysis showed that 20 of the 25 variables were important in discriminating among individuals, with 65% classification success. We used factor analysis to reduce the large number of variables to a set of seven meaningful call features. All of these features differed among individuals, suggesting that American Crows have the potential to discriminate among individual birds on the basis of call structure alone. Five of the features differed between the sexes, with call frequency being the most significant. One clearly subordinate male clustered with the females, raising the possibility that social status partially determines the sex-based differences. Encoding of individual identity in alarm contexts may be adaptive if receiver vigilance and approach urgency depend on the status, reliability, or family membership of the alarm signaler.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Yorzinski","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Vehrencamp","given":"Sandra L."},{"family":"McGowan","given":"Kevin J."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Anne B."}],"citation-key":"yorzinskiInflectedAlarmCaw2006","container-title":"The Condor","DOI":"10.1093/condor/108.3.518","ISSN":"0010-5422, 1938-5129","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"518-529","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Inflected Alarm Caw of the American Crow: Differences in Acoustic Structure Among Individuals and Sexes","title-short":"The Inflected Alarm Caw of the American Crow","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/condor/article/108/3/518/5563553","volume":"108"},{"id":"young1997","abstract":"Pigeons were trained to peck 2 different buttons in response to 16-icon Same versus Different arrays.

Common hosts could distinguish parasites as the result of coevolution, while rare hosts or non-hosts may mistake cuckoos for hawks because rare hosts or non-hosts behave similarly when faced with these two species. Birds usually produce alarm calls in addition to showing behavioral responses when in danger. However, previous studies of identification by rare hosts or non-hosts of sparrowhawks usually lacked experimental evidence of alarm calls. Great tits Parus major, a rare cuckoo host, perform similar behaviors and usually produce alarm calls in response to sparrowhawks and common cuckoos. Here, we tested whether great tits could distinguish common cuckoo from sparrowhawk based on analysis of their alarm calls and the effects of playback of alarm calls on conspecific behavior. Previous studies showed that great tits have a complex communication system that conveys information about predators, and they could perform different kinds of response behavior to different alarm calls. If great tits have not made the ability to distinguish between common cuckoo and sparrowhawk, then their acoustic responses to these two species and their response behaviors in playback experiments should be similar. Specimens of a common cuckoo (parasite), a sparrowhawk (predator) and an Oriental turtle dove Streptopelia orientalis (harmless control) were used to elicit and subsequently record the response behavior and alarm calls of great tits. There was no significant difference in behavioral response among great tits when exposed to the dummy of cuckoo, sparrowhawk and dove. In contrast, they differed significantly in alarm calls. Great tits produced more notes per call that contained increasing D-type and decreasing I-type notes when responding to sparrowhawk as compared to cuckoo or dove. In playback experiments, we found that great tits responded more strongly to great tit hawk than to great tit cuckoo or great tit dove alarm calls. Our study suggests that great tits are able to distinguish sparrowhawks from common cuckoos and convey relevant information in alarm calls by adjusting the number and combinations of notes of a single call type.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Jiangping"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Xiaoying"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Yunlei"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haitao"},{"family":"Møller","given":"Anders Pape"}],"citation-key":"yuAlarmCallbasedDiscrimination2017","container-title":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/eth.12624","ISSN":"1439-0310","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"542-550","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Alarm call-based discrimination between common cuckoo and Eurasian sparrowhawk in a Chinese population of great tits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eth.12624","volume":"123"},{"id":"yueBodySizeDiet2020","abstract":"We examined both historical (1960s) and recent (2017) specimens of an insectivorous bat species (Hipposideros armiger) and a phytophagous bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) from the same latitudinal range to explore phenotypic responses to environmental change in China over the past 65 years. Hipposideros armiger exhibited significant increases in forearm length and three diet-related cranial traits, as well as carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, suggesting that modern H. armiger must travel farther for food and may now use different food resources. In contrast, R. leschenaultii showed no change in forearm length but displayed significant increases in diet-related cranial traits.

However, even if one’s main concern is an accurate assessment of their learning and cognitive abilities, housing them in an enriched environment can have an important effect on the assessment of those abilities. Research has found that the development of the brain of animals is significantly affected by the environment in which they live. Not surprisingly, their ability to learn both simple and complex tasks is affected by even modest time spent in an enriched environment. In particular, animals that are housed in an enriched environment are less impulsive and make more optimal choices than animals housed in isolation. Even the way that they judge the passage of time is affected by their housing conditions. Some researchers have even suggested that exposing animals to an enriched environment can make them more “optimistic” in how they treat ambiguous stimuli. Whether that behavioral effect reflects the subtlety of differences in optimism/pessimism or something simpler, like differences in motivation, incentive, discriminability, or neophobia, it is clear that the conditions of housing can have an important effect on the learning and cognition of animals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Zentall","given":"Thomas R."}],"citation-key":"zentallEffectEnvironmentalEnrichment2021","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani11040973","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"4","page":"973","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Effect of Environmental Enrichment on the Brain and on Learning and Cognition by Animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/4/973","volume":"11"},{"id":"zentallEmergentRelationsFormation1993","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Zentall","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Urcuioli","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"zentallEmergentRelationsFormation1993","container-title":"Psychological Record","container-title-short":"Psychological Record","DOI":"10.1007/BF03395913","ISSN":"00332933","issue":"4","issued":{"season":3,"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"796","publisher":"Springer Nature","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Emergent relations in the formation of stimulus classes by pigeons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=9403212693&lang=fr&site=ehost-live","volume":"43"},{"id":"zentallIdentityBasisBoth","author":[{"family":"Zentall","given":"Thomas R"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Charles A"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Bradley S"},{"family":"Hogan","given":"David E"}],"citation-key":"zentallIdentityBasisBoth","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Identity: The Basis for Both Matching and Oddity Learning in Pigeons","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"zentallSelectiveDividedAttention2005","abstract":"This article reviews some of the research on attentional processes in animals. In the traditional approach to selective attention, it is proposed that in addition to specific response attachments, animals also learn something about the dimension along which the stimuli fall (e.g., hue, brightness, or line orientation). More recently, there has been an attempt to find animal analogs to methodologies originally applied to research with humans. One line of research has been directed to the question of whether animals can locate a target among distracters faster if they are prepared for the presentation of the target (search image and priming). In the study of search image, the target is typically a food item and the cue consists of previous trials on which the same target is presented. In research on priming effects, the cue is typically different from the target but is a good predictor of its occurrence. The study of preattentive processes shows that perceptually, certain stimuli stand out from distracters better than others, depending not only on characteristics of the target relative to the distracters, but also on relations among the distracters. Research on divided attention is examined with the goal of determining whether an animal can process two elements of a compound sample with the same efficiency as one. Taken together, the reviewed research indicates that animals are capable of centrally (not just peripherally) attending to selective aspects of a stimulus display.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Zentall","given":"Thomas R."}],"citation-key":"zentallSelectiveDividedAttention2005","collection-title":"Stimulus Control in Animals: A Tribute to the Contributions of Donald S.

Imperfect detection hampers keeping track of mortality and reproductive events over the whole lifetime of individuals. We propose a new statistical approach to estimate individual fitness while accounting for imperfect detection. Based on hidden process modelling of longitudinal data on marked animals, we show that standard metrics to quantify fitness, namely lifetime reproductive success, individual growth rate and lifetime individual contribution to population growth, can be extended to cope with imperfect detection inherent to most monitoring programs in the wild.

Instead, particularly in studies of natural selection, components of fitness are measured as surrogates for fitness. In this article, we develop an integrated measure of fitness based on the philosophical underpinnings provided by the notion of propensity fitness, combined with classical demographic methods. We show how life-history data, collected for an individual, can be formatted as an age-structured population projection matrix, A(m). The dominant eigenvalue, λ(m), of this matrix is an estimate of that individual's propensity fitness. Using life-history data sets on European sparrowhawks and blue tits, we show that the interpretation of analyses of selection can shift radically using the integrated propensity fitness measure instead of components of fitness, such as lifetime reproductive output. Individual fitness, as formulated here, provides an integrated measure of performance that should prove useful in empirical studies in ecology and evolutionary biology.","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/285839","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"1","note":"publisher: The University of Chicago Press","page":"47-64","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Estimation of Individual Fitness from Life-History Data","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285839","volume":"147","author":[{"family":"McGraw","given":"James B."},{"family":"Caswell","given":"Hal"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,22]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",1]]},"citation-key":"mcgrawEstimationIndividualFitness1996a","library":"My Library","citekey":"mcgrawEstimationIndividualFitness1996a"},{"id":"coulsonEstimatingIndividualContributions2005","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Ecological and evolutionary change is generated by variation in individual performance.

Here, we provide a statistical model to measure varying selective optima from longitudinal data.

A key statistical tool to estimate this variation is the\n                    animal model\n                    . Typically, the environment is modelled as an external variable independent of the organism, affecting the focal phenotypic trait via phenotypic plasticity. We studied what happens if the environment is not independent of the organism because it chooses or adjusts its environment, potentially creating non‐zero genotype–environment correlations.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We simulated a set of biological scenarios assuming the presence or absence of a genetic basis for a focal phenotypic trait and/or the focal environment (treated as an extended phenotype), as well as phenotypic plasticity (the effect of the environment on the phenotypic trait) and/or ‘environmental plasticity’ (the effect of the phenotypic trait on the local environment).

We show that when the focal environment has a genetic basis, the additive genetic variance of a phenotypic trait increases if there is phenotypic plasticity. We also show that phenotypic plasticity can be mistakenly inferred to exist when it is actually absent and instead environmental plasticity is present. When the causal relationship between the phenotype and the environment is misunderstood, it can lead to severe misinterpretation of the genetic parameters, including finding ‘phantom’ genetic variation for traits that, in reality, have none.

Una herramienta clave para su estimación son los “animal models”. Normalmente, el ambiente se modela como una variable externa e independiente al organismo que afecta al carácter fenotípico vía plasticidad fenotípica. Aquí estudiamos qué ocurre si el ambiente no es independiente del organismo porque éste elige o ajusta su ambiente y se generan, de manera potencial, correlaciones genotipo‐ambientales.\n                \n                \n                  Simulamos un conjunto de escenarios biológicos asumiendo la presencia o ausencia de base genética para el rasgo fenotípico y/o el ambiente focal (que es tratado como un fenotipo extendido), conjuntamente con plasticidad fenotípica (el efecto del ambiente sobre el carácter fenotípico) y/o “plasticidad ambiental” (el efecto del carácter fenotípico sobre el ambiente local). A continuación, estimamos la varianza genética aditiva del carácter fenotípico y/o el ambiente local aplicando 5 animal models que diferían en qué variables eran ajustadas como variable dependiente y qué covariables eran incluidas en cada modelo.\n                \n                \n                  Demostramos que los animal models pueden estimar la varianza genética aditiva del ambiente local (es decir, del fenotipo extendido) y pueden estimar la plasticidad ambiental. También, que cuando el ambiente focal tiene base genética, la varianza genética aditiva del carácter fenotípico puede incrementar si existe plasticidad fenotípica. Además, que es posible inferir de manera errónea la existencia de plasticidad fenotípica cuando existe plasticidad ambiental. Una malinterpretación de la relación causal entre fenotipo y ambiente puede conllevar a una grave interpretación errónea de los parámetros genéticos, incluyendo la identificación de una variación genética “fantasma” para los distintos caracteres que en realidad no existe.

Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters.

This article presents a path analysisbased description of the environmental confounding problem, which clarifies the issue and motivates simpler analyses as potential solutions. We show how standard selection analyses can be expanded to explicitly include environmental variables that may confound trait-fitness relationships, potentially leading to dramatically improved predictions of the evolutionary response to selection relative to classical phenotype-based estimates. We provide both univariate and multivariate treatments of the decomposition of the selection differential into components that may cause evolution via direct and indirect selection and components representing evolutionarily inert, environmentally-induced covariance. The multivariate treatment also yields expressions for the decomposition of the selection differential based on extended selection gradients, which may be of wide general interest beyond the environmental problem. Our approach to the environmental confounding problem makes more plausible demands on data than previous, more involved, quantitative genetic approaches, and addresses the issue of environmental confounding in a more biologically informative way.","DOI":"10.1101/2022.06.15.496257","language":"en","source":"Evolutionary Biology","title":"Phenotypic selection analysis and confounding environmental variables","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.06.15.496257","author":[{"family":"Morrissey","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Henshaw","given":"Jonathan M."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,29]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"citation-key":"morrisseyPhenotypicSelectionAnalysis2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"morrisseyPhenotypicSelectionAnalysis2022"},{"id":"ImportanceScaleEvolutionary","type":"webpage","title":"On the importance of scale in evolutionary quantitative genetics | Evolution | Oxford Academic","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article-abstract/78/9/1523/7694271?login=true","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,2]]},"citation-key":"ImportanceScaleEvolutionary","library":"My Library","citekey":"ImportanceScaleEvolutionary"},{"id":"dupontLitterSexComposition2015a","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Oecologia","DOI":"10.1007/s00442-015-3375-6","ISSN":"0029-8549, 1432-1939","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Oecologia","language":"en","page":"753-763","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Litter sex composition influences dominance status of Alpine marmots (Marmota marmota)","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00442-015-3375-6","volume":"179","author":[{"family":"Dupont","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Pradel","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Lardy","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"citation-key":"dupontLitterSexComposition2015a","library":"My Library","citekey":"dupontLitterSexComposition2015a"},{"id":"dingemanseMostPublishedSelection2021","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Ecologists and evolutionary biologists routinely estimate selection gradients.

While this is typically quantified based on genetic variation in a focal individual for its own traits (direct genetic effects, DGEs), when social interactions occur, genetic variation in interacting partners can influence a focal individual’s traits (indirect genetic effects, IGEs). Theory and studies on domesticated species have suggested IGEs can greatly impact evolutionary trajectories, but whether this is true more broadly remains unclear. Here we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the amount of trait variance explained by IGEs and the contribution of IGEs to predictions of adaptive potential. We identified 180 effect sizes from 47 studies across 21 species and found that, on average, IGEs of a single social partner account for a small but statistically significant amount of phenotypic variation (0.03). As IGEs affect the trait values of each interacting group member and due to a typically positive – although statistically nonsignificant – correlation with DGEs (\n            r\n            DGE-IGE\n            = 0.26), IGEs ultimately increase trait heritability substantially from 0.27 (narrow-sense heritability) to 0.45 (total heritable variance). This 66% average increase in heritability suggests IGEs can increase the amount of genetic variation available to selection. Furthermore, whilst showing considerable variation across studies, IGEs were most prominent for behaviours, and to a lesser extent for reproduction and survival, in contrast to morphological, metabolic, physiological, and development traits. Our meta-analysis therefore shows that IGEs tend to enhance the evolutionary potential of traits, especially for those tightly related to interactions with other individuals such as behaviour and reproduction.\n          \n          \n            Lay Summary\n            Predicting evolutionary change is important for breeding better livestock and crops, for understanding how biodiversity arises and how populations respond to environmental change. Normally, these predictions are based on how the genetic variants in an organism influence its own traits (characteristics). However, when organisms socially interact, for instance by fighting or cooperating, then the genes in one individual can influence the traits of others, therefore affecting the potential for evolutionary change. We compared 47 studies across 21 animal species and found that the effect of the genes of a single social partner is small but statistically significant, while the total contribution of social genetic effects to evolutionary potential is large. These effects are particularly important for the evolution of animals’ behaviours and reproductive traits, but less so for other traits such as body size and physiology. We also found that, because an individual can interact with many others and influence them all, social interactions can substantially increase the potential for a population to evolve from generation to generation. Our results show how social interactions can potentially alter the evolution of those traits known to respond to social interactions in comparison to standard expectations.","DOI":"10.1101/2024.05.17.594196","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","source":"Evolutionary Biology","title":"Indirect genetic effects increase the heritable variation available to selection and are largest for behaviours: a meta-analysis","title-short":"Indirect genetic effects increase the heritable variation available to selection and are largest for behaviours","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2024.05.17.594196","author":[{"family":"Santostefano","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Moiron","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Sánchez-Tójar","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"David N"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"citation-key":"santostefanoIndirectGeneticEffects2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"santostefanoIndirectGeneticEffects2024"},{"id":"baudGeneticVariationSocial2017","type":"article-journal","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006498","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"PLoS Genet","language":"en","page":"e1006498","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genetic Variation in the Social Environment Contributes to Health and Disease","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006498","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Baud","given":"Amelie"},{"family":"Mulligan","given":"Megan K."},{"family":"Casale","given":"Francesco Paolo"},{"family":"Ingels","given":"Jesse F."},{"family":"Bohl","given":"Casey J."},{"family":"Callebert","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Launay","given":"Jean-Marie"},{"family":"Krohn","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Legarra","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Stegle","given":"Oliver"}],"editor":[{"family":"Feldman","given":"Marcus W."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,25]]},"citation-key":"baudGeneticVariationSocial2017","library":"My Library","citekey":"baudGeneticVariationSocial2017"},{"id":"pujolMissingResponseSelection2018b","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.tree.2018.02.007","ISSN":"0169-5347","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","language":"English","note":"publisher: Elsevier\nPMID: 29628266","page":"337-346","source":"www.cell.com","title":"The Missing Response to Selection in the Wild","URL":"https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(18)30039-9","volume":"33","author":[{"family":"Pujol","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Blanchet","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Charmantier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Danchin","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Facon","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Marrot","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Roux","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Scotti","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Teplitsky","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Thomson","given":"Caroline E."},{"family":"Winney","given":"Isabel"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,1]]},"citation-key":"pujolMissingResponseSelection2018b","library":"My Library","citekey":"pujolMissingResponseSelection2018b"},{"id":"mooreMothersLegacyStrength2019b","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Although mothers influence the traits of their offspring in many ways beyond the transmission of genes, it remains unclear how important such ‘maternal effects’ are to phenotypic differences among individuals.

Maternal effects most greatly affect morphology and phenology but, surprisingly, are not stronger in species with prolonged maternal care than in species without. While maternal effects influence juvenile traits more than adult traits on average, they do not decline across ontogeny for behaviour or physiology, and they do not weaken across the life cycle in species without maternal care.

The coefficient simultaneously describes the form of changes in trait expression caused by genes in the social environment and predicts the evolutionary consequences of those IGEs. Here, we report a striking mismatch between theoretical emphasis on ψ and its usage in empirical studies. Surveying all IGE research, we find that the coefficient ψ has not been equivalently conceptualized across studies. Several issues related to its proper empirical measurement have recently been raised, and these may severely distort interpretations about the evolutionary consequences of IGEs. We provide practical advice on avoiding such pitfalls. The majority of empirical IGE studies use an alternative variance-partitioning approach rooted in well-established statistical quantitative genetics, but several hundred estimates of ψ (from 15 studies) have been published. A significant majority are positive. In addition, IGEs with feedback, that is, involving the same trait in both interacting partners, are far more likely to be positive and of greater magnitude. Although potentially challenging to measure without bias, ψ has critically-developed theoretical underpinnings that provide unique advantages for empirical work. We advocate for a shift in perspective for empirical work, from ψ as a description of IGEs, to ψ as a robust predictor of evolutionary change. Approaches that “run evolution forward” can take advantage of ψ to provide falsifiable predictions about specific trait interactions, providing much-needed insight into the evolutionary consequences of IGEs.","container-title":"Journal of Heredity","DOI":"10.1093/jhered/esab056","ISSN":"0022-1503, 1465-7333","issue":"1","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"79-90","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Indirect Genetic Effect Interaction Coefficient <i>ψ</i> : Theoretically Essential and Empirically Neglected","title-short":"The Indirect Genetic Effect Interaction Coefficient <i>ψ</i>","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/113/1/79/6429294","volume":"113","author":[{"family":"Bailey","given":"Nathan W"},{"family":"Desjonquères","given":"Camille"}],"editor":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Kim"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,17]]},"citation-key":"baileyIndirectGeneticEffect2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"baileyIndirectGeneticEffect2022"},{"id":"bijmaEstimatingIndirectGenetic2010","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Social interactions among individuals are abundant both in natural and domestic populations. Such social interactions cause phenotypes of individuals to depend on genes carried by other individuals, a phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGE).

Very little is known, however, of statistical power and optimum experimental designs for estimating IGEs. This work, therefore, presents expressions for the standard errors of the estimated (co)variances of DGEs and IGEs and identifies optimum experimental designs for their estimation. It also provides an expression for optimum family size and a numerical investigation of optimum group size. Designs with groups composed of two families were optimal and substantially better than designs with groups composed at random with respect to family. Results suggest that IGEs can be detected with ∼1000–2000 individuals and/or ∼250–500 groups when using optimum designs. Those values appear feasible for agriculture and aquaculture and for the smaller laboratory species. In summary, this work provides the tools to optimize and quantify the required size of experiments aiming to identify IGEs. An R-package SE.IGE is available, which predicts SEs and identifies optimum family and group sizes.","container-title":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.110.120493","ISSN":"0016-6731","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Genetics","note":"PMID: 20713688\nPMCID: PMC2975294","page":"1013-1028","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Estimating Indirect Genetic Effects: Precision of Estimates and Optimum Designs","title-short":"Estimating Indirect Genetic Effects","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2975294/","volume":"186","author":[{"family":"Bijma","given":"Piter"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11]]},"citation-key":"bijmaEstimatingIndirectGenetic2010","library":"My Library","citekey":"bijmaEstimatingIndirectGenetic2010"},{"id":"wolfWhatAreMaternal2009","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Maternal effects can play an important role in a diversity of ecological and evolutionary processes such as population dynamics, phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, life-history evolution and the evolutionary response to selection.

We suggest a definition of maternal effects as the causal influence of the maternal genotype or phenotype on the offspring phenotype. This definition differs from some definitions in that it treats maternal effects as a phenomenon, not as a statistical construct. The causal link to maternal genotype or phenotype is the critical component of this definition providing the link between maternal effects and evolutionary and ecological processes.

It is therefore essential to understand how maternal effects contribute to phenotypic variation in offspring traits and test key assumptions of additive genetic variance in evolutionary models. We measured 5 traits linked to fitness in lizards (endurance, sprint speed, snout-vent length [SVL], mass, and growth rate) and estimated the contribution of additive genetic and maternal effects in explaining variation in these traits in the Eastern water skink (Eulamprus quoyii). We estimated parentage using 6 microsatellite DNA loci from lizards taking part in a mating experiment in large seminatural enclosures and used animal models to partition variance into additive genetic and maternal effects. We found that only endurance was significantly heritable (h2 = 0.37, 95% credible interval = 0.18–0.50), whereas all other traits were either strongly influenced by maternal effects (mass, sprint speed, SVL, and captive growth rate) or were influenced by environmental variability (wild growth rate). Our study disentangles the relative contributions of additive genetic and maternal effects in contributing to variation in offspring phenotypes and suggests that little additive genetic variance exists for traits often assumed to be heritable. Although the heritability of phenotypic traits is essential in evolutionary models, our results also highlight the important role maternal effects have in explaining variation in phenotypes.","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/aru032","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Behavioral Ecology","page":"633-640","source":"Silverchair","title":"Maternal and additive genetic effects contribute to variation in offspring traits in a lizard","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/aru032","volume":"25","author":[{"family":"Noble","given":"Daniel W.A."},{"family":"McFarlane","given":"S.

Maternal genetic effects (MGEs) on fitness might, therefore, represent an underappreciated source of adaptive potential in wild populations. Here we used two decades of data from a pedigreed wild population of North American red squirrels to show that MGEs on offspring fitness increased the population's evolvability by over two orders of magnitude relative to expectations from direct genetic effects alone. MGEs are predicted to maintain more variation than direct genetic effects in the face of selection, but we also found evidence of maternal effect trade-offs. Mothers that raised high-fitness offspring in one environment raised low-fitness offspring in another environment.

Here we estimate maternal effects on early-life traits in a feral population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) from St Kilda, Scotland. We then partition the maternal effects into genetic and environmental components to obtain the ﬁrst direct estimates of maternal genetic effects in a free-living population, and furthermore test for covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects. Using an animal model approach, direct heritabilities (h2) were low but maternal genetic effects (m2) represented a relatively large proportion of the total phenotypic variance for each trait (birth weight m2 ¼ 0.119, birth date m2 ¼ 0.197, natal litter size m2 ¼ 0.211). A negative correlation between direct and maternal genetic effects was estimated for each trait, but was only statistically signiﬁcant for natal litter size (ram ¼ )0.714). Total heritabilities (incorporating variance from heritable maternal effects and the direct-maternal genetic covariance) were signiﬁcant for birth weight and birth date but not for natal litter size. Inadequately speciﬁed models greatly overestimated additive genetic variance and hence direct h2 (by a factor of up to 6.45 in the case of birth date). We conclude that failure to model heritable maternal variance can result in over- or underestimation of the potential for traits to respond to selection, and advocate an increased effort to explicitly measure maternal genetic effects in evolutionary studies.","container-title":"Journal of Evolutionary Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00824.x","ISSN":"1010-061X, 1420-9101","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"J of Evolutionary Biology","language":"en","page":"405-414","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Maternal genetic effects set the potential for evolution in a free‐living vertebrate population","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article/18/2/405-414/7323686","volume":"18","author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"A.

During this time, the use of 'wild quantitative genetics' has provided insights into a range of important questions in evolutionary ecology, ranging from studies conducting research in well-established fields such as life-history theory, behavioural ecology and sexual selection, to others addressing relatively new issues such as populations' responses to climate change or the process of senescence in natural environments. Across these fields, there is increasing appreciation of the need to quantify the genetic - rather than just the phenotypic - basis and diversity of key traits, the genetic basis of the associations between traits, and the interaction between these genetic effects and the environment. This research activity has been fuelled by methodological advances in both molecular genetics and statistics, as well as by exciting results emerging from laboratory studies of evolutionary quantitative genetics, and the increasing availability of suitable long-term datasets collected in natural populations, especially in animals. Quantitative Genetics in the Wild is the first book to synthesize the current level of knowledge in this exciting and rapidly-expanding area. This comprehensive volume also offers exciting perspectives for future studies in emerging areas, including the application of quantitative genetics to plants or arthropods, unraveling the molecular basis of variation in quantitative traits, or estimating non-additive genetic variance. Since this book deals with many fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology, it should be of interest to graduate, post-graduate students, and academics from a wide array of fields such as animal behaviour, ecology, evolution, and genetics.","ISBN":"978-0-19-165595-1","language":"en","note":"Google-Books-ID: TCyTAwAAQBAJ","number-of-pages":"293","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"Quantitative Genetics in the Wild","author":[{"family":"Charmantier","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Garant","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E.

Recent empirical studies suggest the importance of temporally varying selection, as allele frequencies have been found to fluctuate substantially in the wild. However, previous theory suggests that the conditions for the maintenance of genetic variation under temporally fluctuating selection are quite restrictive. Using mathematical models, we demonstrate that maternal genetic effects, whereby maternal genotypes affect offspring phenotypes, can facilitate the maintenance of polymorphism in temporally varying environments. Maternal effects result in mismatches between genotypes and phenotypes, thereby buffering the influence of selection on allele frequency. This decreases the magnitude of allele-frequency fluctuations and creates conditions for the maintenance of variation when selection causes fluctuations. Therefore, maternal effects may result in a temporal storage effect (“maternal storage effect”). On the other hand, when selection does not cause fluctuations (e.g., linear negative frequency-dependent selection), maternal genetic effects moderate the relative importance of selection compared to genetic drift and promote stochastic allele extinction in finite populations. Thus, maternal effects can play an important role in the maintenance of polymorphism, but the direction of the effect depends on the nature of selection.","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/evo.13118","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"2","language":"en","license":"© 2016 The Author(s).

Some maternal effects can act to increase offspring fitness and are called ‘adaptive maternal effects’. However, other maternal effects decrease offspring fitness and there is confusion regarding whether certain maternal effects are indeed adaptive or merely physiological inevitabilities. Here we suggest that the focus on the consequences of maternal effects for offspring fitness only and the use of ‘snapshot’ estimates of fitness have misdirected our effort to understand the evolution of maternal effects. We suggest that selection typically acts on maternal effects to maximise maternal rather than (or in addition to) offspring fitness. We highlight the importance of considering how maternal effects influence maternal fitness across a mother's lifetime and describe four broad types of maternal effects using an outcome-based approach. Overall, we suggest that many maternal effects will have an adaptive basis for mothers, regardless of whether these effects increase or decrease survival or reproductive success of individual offspring.","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16203.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"12","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16203.x","page":"1957-1963","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"When is a maternal effect adaptive?","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16203.x","volume":"116","author":[{"family":"J.

The genetical theory of natural selection. 1st ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press), it represents the rate of adaptive evolution. However, to date, there are few estimates of σA2(w) in natural populations. Moreover, most of the available estimates rely on Gaussian assumptions inappropriate for fitness data, with unclear consequences. “Generalized linear animal models” (GLAMs) tend to be more appropriate for fitness data, but they estimate parameters on a transformed (“latent”) scale that is not directly interpretable for inferences on the data scale. Here we exploit the latest theoretical developments to clarify how best to estimate quantitative genetic parameters for fitness. Specifically, we use computer simulations to confirm a recently developed analog of the FTNS in the case when expected fitness follows a log-normal distribution. In this situation, the additive genetic variance in absolute fitness on the latent log-scale (σA2(l)) equals (σA2(w)) on the data scale, which is the rate of adaptation within a generation. However, due to inheritance distortion, the change in mean relative fitness between generations exceeds σA2(l) and equals (exp⁡(σA2(l))−1). We illustrate why the heritability of fitness is generally low and is not a good measure of the rate of adaptation. Finally, we explore how well the relevant parameters can be estimated by animal models, comparing Gaussian models with Poisson GLAMs. Our results illustrate 1) the correspondence between quantitative genetics and population dynamics encapsulated in the FTNS and its log-normal-analog and 2) the appropriate interpretation of GLAM parameter estimates.","container-title":"Journal of Heredity","DOI":"10.1093/jhered/esz018","ISSN":"0022-1503, 1465-7333","issue":"4","language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","page":"383-395","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Estimation of Genetic Variance in Fitness, and Inference of Adaptation, When Fitness Follows a Log-Normal Distribution","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/110/4/383/5523732","volume":"110","author":[{"family":"Bonnet","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Morrissey","given":"Michael B"},{"family":"Kruuk","given":"Loeske E B"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"citation-key":"bonnetEstimationGeneticVariance2019","library":"My Library","citekey":"bonnetEstimationGeneticVariance2019"},{"id":"HttpsJarrodbioedacukHadfield2012pdf","type":"webpage","title":"https://jarrod.bio.ed.ac.uk/Hadfield.2012.pdf","URL":"https://jarrod.bio.ed.ac.uk/Hadfield.2012.pdf","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,16]]},"citation-key":"HttpsJarrodbioedacukHadfield2012pdf","library":"My Library","citekey":"HttpsJarrodbioedacukHadfield2012pdf"},{"id":"hadfieldQuantitativeGeneticTheory2012","type":"chapter","container-title":"The Evolution of Parental Care","ISBN":"978-0-19-969257-6","language":"en","note":"DOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199692576.003.0015\nDOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199692576.003.0015","page":"267-284","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The quantitative genetic theory of parental effects","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/25631/chapter/193042669","editor":[{"family":"Royle","given":"Nick J."},{"family":"Smiseth","given":"Per T."}],"container-author":[{"family":"Kölliker","given":"Mathias"}],"author":[{"family":"Hadfield","given":"Jarrod"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8,9]]},"citation-key":"hadfieldQuantitativeGeneticTheory2012","library":"My Library","citekey":"hadfieldQuantitativeGeneticTheory2012"},{"id":"huangMaleReproductiveCycle1997","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The male reproductive cycle of the toad, Bufo melanostictus, was studied with emphasis on spermatogenic activity, plasma androgen, and changes in the weights of testes, liver, and fat bodies.

However, the genetic targets of female mate choice are not clearly identiﬁed and whether female mate choice is based on neutral genetic characteristics or on particular functional loci remains an open question. Here, we investigated the genetic targets of female mate choice in Alpine marmots (Marmota marmota), a socially monogamous mammal where extra-pair paternity (EPP) occurs. We used 16 microsatellites to describe neutral genetic characteristics and two MHC loci belonging to MHC class I and II as functional genetic characteristics. Our results reveal that (1) neutral and MHC genetic characteristics convey different information in this species, (2) social pairs show a higher MHC class II dissimilarity than expected under random mate choice, and (3) the occurrence of EPP increases when social pairs present a high neutral genetic similarity or dissimilarity but also when they present low MHC class II dissimilarity. Thus, female mate choice is based on both neutral and MHC genetic characteristics, and the genetic characteristics targeted seem to be context dependent (i.e., the genes involved in social mate choice and genetic mate choice differ). We emphasize the need for empirical studies of mate choice in the wild using both neutral and MHC genetic characteristics because whether neutral and functional genetic characteristics convey similar information is not universal.","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Mate choice for neutral and MHC genetic characteristics in Alpine marmots: different targets in different contexts?","author":[{"family":"Ferrandiz-Rovira","given":"Mariona"},{"family":"Allaine","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Callait-Cardinal","given":"Marie-Pierre"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"citation-key":"ferrandiz-roviraMateChoiceNeutral2016","library":"My Library","citekey":"ferrandiz-roviraMateChoiceNeutral2016"},{"id":"cohasGeneticSimilarityPair2008","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.01.012","ISSN":"00033472","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Animal Behaviour","language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"87-95","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The genetic similarity between pair members influences the frequency of extrapair paternity in alpine marmots","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000334720800119X","volume":"76","author":[{"family":"Cohas","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Yoccoz","given":"Nigel Gilles"},{"family":"Bonenfant","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Goossens","given":"Benoît"},{"family":"Genton","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Galan","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Kempenaers","given":"Bart"},{"family":"Allainé","given":"Dominique"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]},"citation-key":"cohasGeneticSimilarityPair2008","library":"My Library","citekey":"cohasGeneticSimilarityPair2008"}]
