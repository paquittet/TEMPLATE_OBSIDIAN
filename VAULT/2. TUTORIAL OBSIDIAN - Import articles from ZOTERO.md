# ZOTERO SETUP
Before anything, you need to steup your Zotero with the blugin `betterbibtex`. It is fairly simple and the tutorial is available here : https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd

> Note that you just have to setup Zotero (part I. of the link's tutorial, because the Obsidian setup is already made in the following template)

# STEPS TO IMPORT AN ARTICLE
* Access the command palette with `CTRL + p` (in Windows) 
* Search for "Zotero Integration : CREATE A READING SHEET (ARTICLE)" and click

> [!info]
> Zotero needs to be open in order for this to work.

* Write in the toolbar the name of the article you want to find in your library (can be the DOI, the title, the citekey...) (sometimes, the toolbar can be hidden, you have to find it by clicking on the Zotero icon in your research bar)
* Click Enter

> [!tip]
> **If you want the article to have a screenshot of the title + authors** (like in the video), you have to take a screenshot of it and add the comment "title" to the image. It will automatically render the screenshot in the upper part of the literature note
