**DNA methylation** is an epigenetic mechanism that modifies gene expression without altering the genetic sequence itself, by adding methyl groups to DNA bases, often on cytosines. This process plays a crucial role in development and cellular differentiation, as well as in regulating gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. From an evolutionary perspective, methylation can promote phenotypic diversity by allowing genetically similar populations to adapt to different environments. By modulating the expression of specific genes, it contributes to phenotypic plasticity, potentially influencing the survival and reproduction of individuals.
