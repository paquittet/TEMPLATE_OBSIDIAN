It is important to know that you have a **reading mode** and an **editing mode** in Obsidian. You can pass from one to the other by clicking on the open book on the upper-right part of the note :

I suggest you to pass to reading mode while reading this tutorial.

# I. Markdown syntax
**Obsidian** uses Markdown syntax for its notes. If you are familiar with Rmarkdown, it's gonna be fairly simple. Here's a quick overview what's possible : 
* Headers using `#`
* **bold**
* *Italic*
* ==highlight==
* `code`
* Code bloc : 

```r
norm_variable <- rnorm(n = 100)
for(i in 1:length(norm_variable)){
	print(norm_variable[i])
}
```

Also, Obsidian understands LatEx : 

$$
y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_i,  \sigma_e)
$$

# II. And more...
## A. Task
- [ ] task 
- [x] task done

## B. Callouts
> [!info]
> This is a useful information


> [!bug]
> Here's a problem I've encountered


> [!example]
> Useful example

<br>

## C. Insert images
It is pretty straightforward : you can paste an image in any notes with `CTRL + V`. The image will automatically go to the `IMAGE` file.

# III. The core of Obsidian : the link between notes

You can cite any note using `[[name of the note]]` and display its content within another note using `![[name of the note]]`.

For example, in my personal vault, I'd like to have a glossary file where I have word / concept definition. I created one in this template that contains a note called "methylation".

Thanks to this, I can talk about [[methylation]] in another note by citing my glossary note (note that to access the clickable link, you need to be in `reading view`, accessible by clicking to the open book icon in the upright part of the note)
